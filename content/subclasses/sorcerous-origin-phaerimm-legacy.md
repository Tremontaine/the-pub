# Sorcerous Origin: Phaerimm Legacy

Some sorcerers draw their power from an ancient and terrible source—the aberrant magic of the phaerimm. Perhaps your ancestor was exposed to phaerimm experiments, or you were born in a region once saturated with their life-draining magic. Maybe you survived a phaerimm's parasitic reproduction process through magical intervention, leaving you forever changed. Whatever the source, your body now channels the devastating arcane powers that once threatened to turn all of Faerûn into desert.

As a sorcerer with the Phaerimm Legacy, you command magic that drains life, disrupts other spellcasters, and manipulates arcane energy itself. Your powers are feared and mistrusted by many, especially those who know the terrible history of the phaerimm.

### Aberrant Physiology
*1st-level Phaerimm Legacy feature*

Your connection to phaerimm magic has altered your body in subtle ways. You gain the following benefits:

* You can speak, read, and write Deep Speech.
* You gain proficiency in the Arcana skill if you don't already have it.
* Your body requires less moisture to survive. You can go twice as long without water before suffering exhaustion, and you have advantage on saving throws against extreme heat.
* You learn the *chill touch* cantrip if you don't already know it. When you cast it, the spectral hand resembles a miniature phaerimm's claw.

### Arcane Leech
*1st-level Phaerimm Legacy feature*

You can siphon magical energy from nearby spellcasters. When a creature within 30 feet of you casts a spell of 1st level or higher, you can use your reaction to attempt to leech some of its power. The creature must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, you regain sorcery points equal to half the spell's level (rounded up), to a maximum of 2 sorcery points per use.

If you have your maximum number of sorcery points when you use this feature, you instead gain temporary hit points equal to five times the number of sorcery points you would have gained.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded up), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Desert's Touch
*6th-level Phaerimm Legacy feature*

You can infuse your spells with the life-draining essence of the phaerimm. When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can spend 1 sorcery point to change the damage type to necrotic. If you do so, any creature that takes damage from the spell has its speed reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

Additionally, you learn the *desert's touch* spell, which doesn't count against your number of spells known. When you cast it, you can spend 2 sorcery points to cast it as a bonus action instead of an action.

### Spell Disruption
*6th-level Phaerimm Legacy feature*

Your connection to phaerimm magic allows you to disrupt the spellcasting of others. When a creature you can see within 60 feet of you casts a spell, you can use your reaction and spend 2 sorcery points to force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the spell fails and the spell slot is wasted.

If the spell's level is higher than half your sorcerer level (rounded up), the creature has advantage on the saving throw.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Essence Drain
*14th-level Phaerimm Legacy feature*

You can create a parasitic link to drain life force from your enemies. As an action, you can spend 3 sorcery points to target one creature you can see within 60 feet. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a shimmering cord of energy connects you to the target until the end of your next turn.

While the link is active, at the start of the target's turn, it takes 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain hit points equal to half the damage dealt. If the target is a spellcaster, its spellcasting ability score is reduced by 2 until the link ends.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can spend 2 sorcery points to maintain the link for another round. The link also ends if you or the target move more than 60 feet apart, if a solid barrier blocks line of effect between you, or if you establish a new link with a different creature.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Arcane Devastation
*18th-level Phaerimm Legacy feature*

You can channel the most devastating power of the phaerimm—the ability to unleash catastrophic arcane energy. As an action, you can spend 6 sorcery points to unleash a wave of destructive magic in a 30-foot radius centered on yourself.

Each creature in the area must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 8d12 force damage and has its connection to magic damaged for 1 minute. During this time, the creature has disadvantage on saving throws against your spells, and when it casts a spell of 1st level or higher, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or the spell fails and the spell slot is wasted. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and suffers no additional effects.

Additionally, each magical effect in the area that wasn't created by you and isn't being worn or carried must succeed on a special saving throw with a bonus equal to the level of the spell that created it. The DC for this saving throw equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, the effect ends.

For each spell or magical effect that ends because of this feature, you regain 5 hit points.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
