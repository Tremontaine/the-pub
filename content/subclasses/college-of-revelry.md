# College of Revelry

Bards who join the College of Revelry are masters of merriment, celebration, and raising spirits - both figuratively and literally. These performers learn that the greatest power lies in bringing joy to others, and they channel this celebratory energy into their magic and performances.

Found in taverns, festivals, and alehouses across the realms, these bards can turn any gathering into a legendary night of festivities. Their magic is infused with the essence of communal joy, hearty laughter, and sometimes a bit too much ale.

## Bonus Proficiencies
*3rd-level College of Revelry feature*

You gain proficiency with brewer's supplies and cook's utensils. Additionally, you gain proficiency in the Performance skill if you don't already have it, and you double your proficiency bonus for any ability check you make that uses Performance.

## Spirited Performance
*3rd-level College of Revelry feature*

Your performances inspire extraordinary vigor in your allies. When you use your Bardic Inspiration, the recipient can choose to gain temporary hit points equal to the number rolled on the Bardic Inspiration die + your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1) instead of adding the die to an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw.

Additionally, when a creature uses your Bardic Inspiration die and the roll is a success (helps them succeed on an ability check or saving throw, or hit with an attack), they gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of 1).

## Intoxicating Crescendo
*6th-level College of Revelry feature*

You can infuse your performances with magical cheer that disrupts concentration and coordination. As an action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to force each creature of your choice within 30 feet that can hear you to make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, a creature becomes charmed by you for 1 minute.

While charmed in this way, the creature has disadvantage on Wisdom and Intelligence checks and saving throws. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If the creature takes damage, it automatically succeeds on its next saving throw.

## Festival of Fools
*14th-level College of Revelry feature*

Your revelry can reach incredible heights, causing chaos and confusion among your enemies while empowering your allies. As an action, you can create an area of magical celebration that lasts for 1 minute or until you lose concentration (as if concentrating on a spell).

The festivities occur in a 30-foot radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 120 feet of you. The area is filled with spectral music, dancing lights, and the sounds of celebration. When you create this effect and as a bonus action on subsequent turns, you can designate any number of creatures you can see in the area as "revelers."

Revelers gain the following benefits:
- They have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed
- They gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier at the start of each of their turns
- They can use their reaction to move up to half their speed without provoking opportunity attacks

All other creatures in the area must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC or be affected as if by the confusion spell until the start of their next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
