# Way of the Arcane Fist

Monks who follow the Way of the Arcane Fist learn to transform their Ki into arcane energy, allowing them to cast spells and enhance their martial abilities with magical effects.

### Ki Spellcasting
*3rd-level Way of the Arcane Fist feature*

You have learned to channel your Ki into arcane energy. You can cast spells from a limited list, expending Ki points equal to the spell's level.

**Preparing and Casting Spells.** The Way of the Arcane Fist Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have. To cast one of your prepared spells, you must expend Ki points equal to the spell's level.

You prepare spells from the Way of the Arcane Fist spell list. When you do so, choose a number of spells from the list equal to your Wisdom modifier + half your monk level (rounded down). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of spells requires time spent in meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.

**Spellcasting Ability.** Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your spells. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier
**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier

| Monk Level | Spells Known | Maximum Spell Level |
|------------|--------------|---------------------|
| 3rd        | 2            | 1st                 |
| 5th        | 3            | 1st                 |
| 7th        | 4            | 2nd                 |
| 11th       | 5            | 3rd                 |
| 17th       | 6            | 3rd                 |

### Arcane Insight
*3rd-level Way of the Arcane Fist feature*

You learn the Thaumaturgy and Produce Flame cantrips. When you reach 6th level, you learn one additional cantrip of your choice from the following list: Fire Bolt, Ray of Frost, or Shocking Grasp. Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for these cantrips.

Additionally, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill if you don't already have it.

### Spell Strike
*6th-level Way of the Arcane Fist feature*

When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a cantrip. Additionally, when you cast a cantrip that requires an attack roll and hit a creature, you can spend 1 Ki point to make one unarmed strike against that creature as a bonus action.

### Disrupting Strike
*11th-level Way of the Arcane Fist feature*

You can channel disruptive energy through your strikes. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can spend 2 Ki points to cast Dispel Magic targeting only the creature you hit, without expending a spell slot. The spell automatically targets all magical effects on the creature (no need to choose specific effects).

Additionally, when you successfully end a spell effect with Dispel Magic, you regain 1 Ki point.

### Arcane Armor
*17th-level Way of the Arcane Fist feature*

As a bonus action, you can spend 3 Ki points to surround yourself with arcane energy, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:

- You gain resistance to all damage from spells.
- You have advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.
- When you take damage, you can use your reaction to expend 1 Ki point and reduce the damage by an amount equal to your Monk level.
- Once per turn when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you can force it to make a Constitution saving throw against your Ki save DC. On a failed save, the creature has disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes before the end of your next turn.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
