# College of War Dance

Bards of the College of War Dance blend martial prowess with bardic magic, weaving deadly combat techniques with inspiring performances. These warrior-poets are as comfortable on the battlefield as they are in a concert hall, using rhythm and movement to enhance their combat abilities.

### Battle Rhythm
*3rd-level College of War Dance feature*

You gain proficiency with medium armor and shields. Additionally, you can choose one of the following Fighting Styles:

- **Dueling:** When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.
- **Great Weapon Fighting:** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property.
- **Two-Weapon Fighting:** When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

### War Dance
*3rd-level College of War Dance feature*

As a bonus action, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration to enter a War Dance stance that lasts for 1 minute. While in your War Dance:

- Your melee weapon attacks that benefit from your chosen Fighting Style deal additional damage equal to your Bardic Inspiration die.
- Your War Dance ends early if you are incapacitated or if your turn ends and you haven't either attacked a hostile creature or been attacked by a hostile creature since the end of your last turn.
- Instead of attacking or being attacked to maintain your War Dance, you can use your action to inspire an ally, granting them one of your Bardic Inspiration dice (this doesn't count against your normal limit of Bardic Inspiration uses).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Extra Attack
*6th-level College of War Dance feature*

You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Battle Mobility
*6th-level College of War Dance feature*

While your War Dance is active, you can use your bonus action to take the Dash or Disengage action. Alternatively, you can expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration as a bonus action to take the Dodge action until the start of your next turn.

### Spellblade Performance
*14th-level College of War Dance feature*

Your War Dance becomes infused with magical energy. While your War Dance is active:

- You can use your weapon as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.
- You can perform the somatic components of spells even while holding weapons or a shield.
- You don't suffer disadvantage on ranged spell attack rolls due to being within 5 feet of a hostile creature.
- Once per turn when you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack, you can expend one spell slot to deal additional force damage equal to 1d8 per level of the spell slot expended.
