# Cloak of the Desert Maker

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)*

This shimmering cloak appears to be made from the scaled hide of a phaerimm, with a constantly shifting pattern resembling sand dunes. While wearing this cloak, you gain the following benefits:

• You have resistance to fire damage and advantage on Constitution saving throws made to resist exhaustion from hot environments.
• You can cast *create or destroy water* (destroy only) at will, without using a spell slot.
• As an action, you can create a 20-foot-radius sphere of desiccating energy centered on yourself. Each creature in the area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 6d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Plant creatures and water elementals have disadvantage on this saving throw. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.
