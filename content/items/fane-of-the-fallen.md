# Fane of the Fallen

*Weapon (dagger), artifact (requires attunement)*

This curved black dagger has a hilt ending with a black gemstone that seems to absorb all light around it. The blade appears to shimmer with an otherworldly darkness, as if it exists partially in another plane. You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It deals 2d4 slashing damage and has the finesse, light, and thrown (20/60 ft.) properties.

> *"I've seen what happens to those killed by the Fane. Their eyes go hollow as their very essence is torn away—not just their life, but everything they were or could have been."*

Whenever you slay a creature with an attack using this dagger, the creature's soul is consumed by The Glabrezu, fueling the dagger's powers. That creature cannot be restored to life by any means. As the soul is devoured, the gemstone briefly pulses with a deep crimson light, and those nearby might hear a faint, satisfied whisper in an unknown tongue.

**Sentience.** The Fane of the Fallen is a sentient chaotic neutral weapon with an Intelligence of 21, a Wisdom of 24, and a Charisma of 24. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 120 feet. The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Demonic, Drow and Common.

**Personality.** The Glabrezu lives within the Fane of the Fallen for reasons unknown. It yearns to cause chaos, learning its wielder's principles and then using those ideals to achieve its goals. The Glabrezu whispers ideas of revolution to its wielder. Its voice is seductive and persuasive, often presenting destructive ideas as necessary steps toward justice or freedom. Those who have wielded the dagger for extended periods report hearing the Glabrezu's laughter in their dreams.

**Benefits.** The Fane of the Fallen grants its wielder the following benefits:

* You can speak, read, and write Demonic. When you speak this language, your voice takes on a subtle, unsettling resonance.
* Immediately after you make a ranged attack with this weapon, it returns to your hand, trailing wisps of shadow as it flies back to you.
* After a living creature is wounded by the Fane of the Fallen, for the next 24 hours, The Glabrezu knows the direction to the target. You can sense this knowledge as a persistent tugging sensation pulling you toward your prey.
* While holding the weapon, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it (save DC 21): *detect evil and good*, *borrowed knowledge*, *enthrall*, or *skill empowerment*. Once a spell has been cast using the Fane of the Fallen, that spell can't be cast from the dagger again until the next dusk. When casting these spells, the gemstone in the hilt glows with an inner light that casts eerie shadows.

**Wounding Effects.** When you wound a target with the Fane of the Fallen, you can subject it to one of the following effects of your choice. An effect can't be used again until you finish a rest. Each effect manifests with distinct visual and sensory phenomena:

* **Acid.** The target must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw, taking an additional 5d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The wound bubbles and hisses as a viscous, otherworldly ichor eats away at flesh and armor alike.

* **Blindness.** The target takes 1d10 necrotic damage. In addition, the target and all other creatures within 20 feet of it must each make a successful DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn. A cloud of impenetrable darkness momentarily erupts from the wound, leaving those affected with eyes that appear as empty voids.

* **Concussion.** The target and each creature within 20 feet of it must make a DC 21 Constitution saving throw, taking 2d12 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The strike releases a shockwave of demonic energy that distorts the air and leaves a lingering ringing in the ears of those affected.

* **Entanglement.** The target must make a successful DC 21 Dexterity saving throw or be restrained for 1 hour by strands of sticky webbing. The target can escape by taking an action to make a DC 21 Athletics or Acrobatics check and succeeding. The webbing appears as if woven from shadows and moonlight, unnaturally strong yet almost ethereal in appearance.

* **Paralysis.** The target takes 4d10 lightning damage and must make a successful DC 21 Constitution saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. The paralyzed target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Crackling energy the color of a bruise courses through the victim's body, leaving them rigid as their muscles lock in place.
