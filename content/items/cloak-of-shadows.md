# Cloak of Shadows

This dark, smoky cloak seems to constantly shift and swirl, as if made from living shadows.

## Properties

While wearing this cloak, you gain the following benefits:

- You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.
- Once per day, you can use an action to cast the *darkness* spell centered on yourself, without requiring concentration or components. The darkness created this way moves with you.
- You have resistance to necrotic damage.

## Curse

This cloak is cursed, although this is not revealed by an *identify* spell. While attuned to the cloak, you are more vulnerable to bright light. You have disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks while in bright light.

## History

These cloaks were originally created by the shadowfell-touched wizards of the Umbral Court. They were given as gifts to their most trusted spies and assassins, allowing them to move undetected through the material plane.
