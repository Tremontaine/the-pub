# Staff of the Phaerimm

*Staff, legendary (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*

This imposing staff is made from the spine of an elder phaerimm, topped with a crystalline formation that pulses with arcane energy. The staff has 20 charges and regains 2d8+4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff crumbles to dust.

While holding the staff, you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls and to the saving throw DCs of your spells. Additionally, you can use an action to expend charges to cast the following spells from it (using your spell save DC): *counterspell* (3 charges), *dispel magic* (3 charges), *disintegrate* (6 charges), *finger of death* (7 charges), *mage-slayer's curse* (3 charges), *telekinesis* (5 charges), or *wall of force* (5 charges).

When you cast *counterspell* or *dispel magic* from the staff against a spell of 4th level or lower, that spell is automatically countered or dispelled without requiring an ability check.
