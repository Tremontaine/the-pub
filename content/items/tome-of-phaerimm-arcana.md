# Tome of Phaerimm Arcana

*Wondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This ancient tome is bound in the leathery hide of a phaerimm and contains spells and arcane knowledge from the height of their power. When you attune to this tome, you can add *Desert's Touch*, *Desert's Embrace*, and *Weirdshield* spells to your spellbook, spell list, or spells known. These spells count as spells for your class but don't count against the number of spells you know.

Additionally, the tome has 7 charges and regains 1d4+3 expended charges daily at dawn. While holding the tome, you can expend charges to gain the following benefits:

* When you cast a spell that deals damage, you can expend 1 charge to change the damage type to necrotic.
* When you cast a spell that requires concentration, you can expend 2 charges to maintain concentration on that spell if you fail a concentration check.
* When you cast a spell of 5th level or lower that targets only one creature, you can expend 3 charges to target a second creature within range with the same spell.
* You can expend 5 charges to cast *Arcane Severance* without using a spell slot.
* You can expend 7 charges to cast *Arcane Devastation* without using a spell slot. If you use Tome of Phaerimm Arcana to cast *Arcane Devastation*, there is a 33 percent chance that this tome will crumble to dust.
