# Staff of the Spectral Apprentice

*Staff, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This staff, a less powerful replica of the Staff of the Spectral Mage, is crafted from ghostly shimmering wood and adorned with simple, ethereal gemstones.

The staff has 10 charges and regains 1d4 + 2 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff dissipates into ethereal mist and is lost.

While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier:
- *Mage Hand* (1 charge)
- *Shield* (1 charge)
- *Invisibility* (2 charges)
- *Counterspell* (3 charges)

**Ghostly Defense.** While you are holding the staff, you have resistance to necrotic damage, and you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 5 (1d10) force damage if you end your turn inside an object.

**Ethereal Insight.** When you hit with a spell attack using the staff, you can expend 2 charges to gain insight into your enemy. Until the end of your next turn, against that enemy, you have advantage on attack rolls, spell attack rolls, and your enemy have disadvantage on saving throws against your spells and abilities.
