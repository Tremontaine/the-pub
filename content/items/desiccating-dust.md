# Desiccating Dust

*Wondrous item, uncommon*

This small pouch contains fine, pale sand that radiates faint necromantic energy. As an action, you can sprinkle this dust over an area up to 10 feet square. All non-magical plants in the area immediately wither and die. Water in the area, up to 10 gallons, evaporates instantly. The pouch contains enough dust for 3 uses.
