# Phaerimm Bone Staff

*Staff, rare (requires attunement by a druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)*

This staff is crafted from the hollowed spine of a phaerimm. It has 10 charges and regains 1d6+4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff crumbles to dust.

While holding the staff, you can use an action to expend charges to cast the following spells from it (spell save DC 15): *arcane lock* (2 charges), *detect magic* (1 charge), *dispel magic* (3 charges), *ray of enfeeblement* (1 charge), or *desert's touch* (2 charges).
