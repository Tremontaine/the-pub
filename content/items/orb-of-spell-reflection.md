# Orb of Spell Reflection

*Wondrous item, very rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)*

This polished crystal orb contains swirling motes of light that resemble stars in a night sky. While holding this orb, when you are targeted by a spell that targets only you (not in an area of effect), you can use your reaction to make an Intelligence check. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the spell is reflected back at the caster, using the original spell save DC and attack bonus. You can use this feature three times per day, and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
