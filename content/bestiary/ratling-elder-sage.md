# Ratling Elder Sage

*Medium humanoid (ratfolk), chaotic evil*

## Physical Description
The ratling elder sage's appearance defies its species' typically short lifespan, with an ancient, wizened form that speaks to centuries rather than decades of existence. Standing nearly six feet tall but hunched with age, its once-vibrant fur has faded to a silvery-white that seems to shimmer with arcane energy. The sage's eyes glow with an inner light that shifts through various colors depending on the magics it is channeling, and intricate runic tattoos cover much of its visible skin, occasionally glowing in response to nearby magical energies. Unlike most ratlings, the elder sage moves with deliberate grace, each gesture precise and controlled. It typically wears elaborate robes woven with metallic threads that form complex magical circuits, and dozens of small crystals hover around its head in a constantly shifting constellation, each one containing a fragment of magical knowledge or a preserved memory.

> *The ancient ratling glides forward, its paws barely seeming to touch the ground. Despite its obvious age, it radiates a palpable aura of power that makes the air itself feel heavy with potential. The constellation of crystals orbiting its head shifts in response to some unseen stimulus, and when it speaks, its voice carries the weight of centuries—simultaneously raspy with age and resonant with accumulated knowledge. The runes etched into its flesh pulse with light that follows the rhythm of arcane energies flowing through the chamber, as if the sage itself is attuned to the very fabric of magic.*

## Lore
**Ageless Anomalies.** Elder sages represent something that should not exist—ratlings whose natural lifespan has been extended far beyond its normal limits through extraordinary magical means. While most ratlings live merely 15-20 years, elder sages have existed for centuries, preserving their knowledge and continuing their studies across multiple generations. Their methods for achieving this longevity are closely guarded secrets, typically involving complex life-extension rituals that must be renewed periodically.

**Living Libraries.** Each elder sage serves as a repository of knowledge for ratling society, their enhanced minds capable of storing vast amounts of information with perfect recall. To supplement their already formidable memories, many elder sages create networks of crystalline memory stones that orbit their bodies, each containing specific knowledge that can be accessed at will. The destruction of these crystals represents one of the few things an elder sage truly fears.

**Magical Innovators.** Unlike most ratling spellcasters who primarily emulate or steal magical traditions from other races, elder sages have had sufficient time to develop uniquely ratling approaches to arcane power. These innovations often emphasize efficiency and adaptability over raw power, allowing them to cast spells with minimal components or to modify existing spells on the fly to suit their current needs.

**Political Puppeteers.** Elder sages rarely rule ratling society directly, preferring to manipulate events from behind the scenes. They take a long view of ratling advancement, sometimes orchestrating plans that unfold over decades or centuries. Other ratling leaders often seek their counsel but are wise to fear their manipulation, as the sages' agendas typically extend far beyond the comprehension of their shorter-lived kin.

> ##### The Council of Nine
> *"The most troubling intelligence we've gathered suggests the existence of a 'Council of Nine'—a conclave of elder sages who coordinate ratling activities across entire continents. Each sage specializes in a particular school of magic and controls a specific geographic region through puppet leaders. They allegedly meet once per decade in a location that constantly shifts between the Material Plane and other realms of existence, making it nearly impossible to track or infiltrate. If this council truly exists, it represents a level of long-term coordination among ratling warrens that we previously thought impossible."*

***Arcane Mastery.*** The sage can cast any wizard spell of 5th level or lower without expending a spell slot, using its spellcasting ability and DC. It can do so three times before requiring a short or long rest to use this ability again.

***Magic Resistance.*** The sage has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Regal Presence.*** Allies within 30 feet of the sage have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the sage fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Memory Crystals.*** The elder sage is surrounded by a constellation of crystals that contain magical knowledge. As a bonus action, the sage can access a crystal to regain an expended spell slot of 5th level or lower. The sage has three such crystals, and each can be used once before becoming inert.

***Multiattack.*** The sage makes two arcane staff attacks or two spell attacks.

***Arcane Staff.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 6) force damage.

***Mind Warp (Recharge 5–6).*** The sage targets a creature it can see within 60 feet. The target must make a DC 23 Intelligence saving throw or take 45 (10d8) psychic damage and be incapacitated until the end of its next turn.

***Arcane Pulse (Recharge 5–6).*** The sage releases a pulse of magical energy in a 30-foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a DC 23 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) force damage and being pushed 10 feet away on a failed save, or half as much damage and not pushed on a successful one.

***Spellcasting.*** The sage is a 20th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 23, +15 to hit with spell attacks). The sage has the following wizard spells prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): *mage hand, prestidigitation, ray of frost, shocking grasp, minor illusion*
* 1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, mage armor, magic missile, shield*
* 2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts, mirror image, misty step, web*
* 3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, dispel magic, fireball, haste*
* 4th level (3 slots): *dimension door, greater invisibility, polymorph*
* 5th level (3 slots): *cone of cold, telekinesis, wall of force*
* 6th level (2 slots): *chain lightning, disintegrate, globe of invulnerability*
* 7th level (2 slots): *forcecage, teleport, prismatic spray*
* 8th level (1 slot): *maze, power word stun*
* 9th level (1 slot): *meteor swarm, time stop, wish*

***Spell Adaptation.*** When the sage casts a spell, it can modify the spell in one of the following ways: change the damage type, increase the range by 50%, affect one additional target, or impose disadvantage on the first saving throw against the spell. Each adaptation can only be used once per short rest.

## Legendary Actions
The sage can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The sage regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Spellcast.*** The sage casts a cantrip or a 1st-level spell.

***Mind Bolt.*** The sage makes a ranged spell attack against one creature it can see within 60 feet. On a hit, the target takes 13 (3d8) psychic damage and must succeed on a DC 23 Wisdom saving throw or be unable to take reactions until the end of the sage's next turn.

***Teleport (Costs 2 Actions).*** The sage magically teleports, along with any equipment it is wearing or carrying, up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space it can see.

***Arcane Recovery (Costs 3 Actions).*** The sage regains one expended spell slot of 5th level or lower.

## Tactics
The ratling elder sage begins combat by assessing threats with its superior intellect, typically using Detect Thoughts to gauge enemy capabilities when possible. It positions itself at optimal distance using flight, maintaining line of sight to allies to benefit them with its Regal Presence. The sage uses Counterspell to disrupt enemy spellcasters and employs battlefield control spells like Forcecage and Wall of Force to isolate powerful threats. Against multiple opponents, it favors area damage spells enhanced with Spell Adaptation to maximize effectiveness. The sage uses its Memory Crystals strategically to recover key spell slots when needed and saves Legendary Resistance for truly dangerous effects. If seriously threatened, it will use Teleport or Dimension Door to escape, often leaving behind summoned creatures or constructs to cover its retreat.

> *The elder sage remains perfectly still as it assesses the situation, the crystalline constellation around its head spinning with increasing speed as it mentally calculates countless variables and probabilities. With a subtle gesture, it alters the fabric of reality around itself, space and time bending to its will. When it finally acts, its movements are economical and precise, each spell woven with centuries of practiced expertise. Multiple magical effects manifest simultaneously as if routine, the sage's mastery allowing it to coordinate complex arcane interactions that would overwhelm lesser mages.*
