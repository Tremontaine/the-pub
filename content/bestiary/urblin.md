# Urblin, the Rubble Tyrant

*Huge monstrosity, unaligned*

## Physical Description
Urblin is a massive, hulking beast with a body seemingly formed from living stone and rubble. Its enormous frame is covered in jagged protrusions and crystalline spines that can be launched as deadly projectiles. Its massive jaws can crush stone and metal alike, while its powerful claws can tear through the toughest materials. Urblin's hide resembles cracked earth and broken stone, providing excellent camouflage in ruined environments.

> The ground trembles with each step as the colossal form emerges from the dust cloud, its silhouette revealing a nightmarish fusion of beast and broken earth.

## Lore
**Origin Mystery**
Scholars debate whether Urblin is a unique entity or one of a rare species. Some theorize it formed naturally in areas of intense seismic activity, while others believe it to be the result of a magical experiment gone wrong, perhaps an elemental binding ritual that created this terrifying hybrid creature.

**Territorial Destroyer**
Urblin is known to claim abandoned ruins and mining complexes as its territory, using its destructive abilities to reshape these environments to its liking. It seems to have an instinctual hatred for constructed buildings and will systematically demolish settlements that encroach upon its domain.

**Hibernation Cycles**
The creature appears to enter long periods of dormancy, sometimes lasting decades, during which it partially buries itself and becomes nearly indistinguishable from natural rock formations. These hibernation periods end unpredictably, often triggered by nearby mining operations or significant seismic events.

> *"The merchants spoke of a city reduced to rubble in a single night, with survivors describing a mountain that moved and roared like thunder. I dismissed it as superstition until I saw the devastation myself—no earthquake could have been so... deliberate."*
> — Magister Valen Thorne, Royal Geographer

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** Urblin makes two attacks with its claws or bite.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) slashing damage.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 26 (3d12 + 6) piercing damage. If the target is Huge or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 18 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone and restrained as Urblin traps it in its jaws. A restrained creature can use its action to try and pry open Urblin's jaws with a DC 18 Strength check.

***Rubble Spines (Recharge 5-6).*** Urblin flings shards of rubble and debris in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) slashing damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Brutish Roar (Recharge 6).*** Urblin unleashes a thunderous roar in a 30-foot radius. Each creature within range must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) thunder damage and be stunned until the end of Urblin's next turn.

## Legendary Actions
Urblin can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Urblin regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

- **Move.** Urblin moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Debris Volley (Costs 2 Actions).** Urblin hurls rubble and debris at one creature within 60 ft. The target must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
- **Collapse (Costs 3 Actions).** Urblin slams the ground within 20 ft. Each creature within 20 ft. must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 44 (8d10) bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone and restrained by rubble. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked prone or restrained. A restrained creature can use its action to try and free itself with a DC 18 Strength check.

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing ties), Urblin can take one lair action to cause one of the following:

- Urblin dislodges rubble in a 20-ft radius. Each creature in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.
- A tremor shakes the lair in a 60-ft radius around Urblin. Each creature on the ground must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.
- Clouds of dust and sand swirl, heavily obscuring the area in a 60-ft radius around Urblin for 1 minute.

## Tactics
Urblin begins combat by using its Brutish Roar to stun opponents, then follows with Rubble Spines to damage multiple foes at once. It prioritizes attacking structures and will use its bite to immobilize spellcasters or ranged attackers. When damaged significantly, it uses its legendary Collapse action to create distance between itself and powerful melee combatants. In its lair, Urblin strategically uses dust clouds to obscure itself while picking off isolated enemies.

> The dust settles to reveal only destruction where the creature once stood, the only evidence of its passage a trail of rubble stretching into the distance like a scar upon the earth.
