# Rotwood Husk

*Medium plant, neutral evil*

## Physical Description
A rotwood husk appears as a humanoid figure composed of decaying wood and rotting vegetation. Standing about 6 feet tall, its body is a mass of blackened, fungi-infested bark and twisted branches that vaguely form a torso, limbs, and a misshapen head. Sickly green and purple fungi grow from various parts of its body, occasionally releasing clouds of spores. The creature moves with an uneven, lurching gait, and parts of its body occasionally crumble away only to be replaced by new growth of corrupted plant matter. Dark, viscous sap oozes from cracks in its bark-like skin, emanating a strong smell of decay and rot.

> *A shambling figure emerges from the murky shadows, its body a grotesque amalgamation of rotting wood and putrid vegetation. Fungi sprout from every crevice, pulsing with an unnatural rhythm. Where it steps, plants blacken and wither, as if the very essence of decay follows in its wake. The air grows thick with the stench of corruption as it turns hollow, glowing eyes in your direction.*

## Lore
**Corrupted Guardians.** Rotwood husks are believed to be the corrupted remains of forest guardians or dryads whose connection to nature was twisted by dark magic, disease, or otherworldly influence. The transformation perverts their original purpose from protecting the forest to spreading decay throughout it.

**Blight Carriers.** Wherever rotwood husks travel, they spread a peculiar form of plant disease that causes accelerated rot and corruption. Healthy trees exposed to a rotwood husk's aura may begin to show signs of this corruption within days, first in discoloration of leaves and bark, then progressing to structural weakness and fungal infestation.

**Collective Blight.** Rotwood husks are drawn to others of their kind, forming small groups called "blights." These collections of corrupted plant creatures work with a hive-mind-like coordination to spread their influence over increasingly larger territories.

**Cycle of Corruption.** The most dangerous aspect of rotwood husks is their ability to propagate. When a plant creature dies within the aura of a rotwood husk, there is a chance it will rise days later as a new husk, continuing the cycle of corruption.

> ##### Druid's Journal
> *"We tried cleansing rituals, fire, even isolation of infected areas. Nothing seems to permanently halt the spread of the rot once it takes hold. I've come to believe these husks aren't just diseased—they're serving some purpose. The patterns of their spread aren't random. It's as if they're preparing the forest for something else, something that thrives in decay."*

***Spore Cloud.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the rotwood husk must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the husk's Spore Cloud for 24 hours.

***Fungal Regeneration.*** The rotwood husk regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn. If the husk takes fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the husk's next turn. The husk dies only if it starts its turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

***Actions***

***Rotting Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d6) necrotic damage.

***Decay Aura.*** Creatures within 10 ft. of the husk must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution save or take 7 (2d6) necrotic damage at the start of their turn. Plant creatures have disadvantage on this saving throw.

## Tactics
Rotwood husks fight with relentless persistence, closing to melee range to make use of both their Rotting Slam and Decay Aura simultaneously. They prioritize attacking plant creatures and druids, seemingly driven by an instinctual desire to corrupt natural life. Multiple husks work together effectively, surrounding targets to maximize the effect of their Decay Auras. They show no fear and will fight until destroyed, though they are intelligent enough to withdraw temporarily if fire is used against them extensively, only to return once the threat has passed.

> *The rotwood husk lurches forward, each movement accompanied by the sound of cracking branches and squelching fungi. As it draws near, surrounding vegetation visibly wilts, leaves curling and branches sagging as if suddenly aged decades in moments. Clouds of spores pulse from its body in rhythmic waves, and the sickly sweet smell of advanced decomposition fills the air.*
