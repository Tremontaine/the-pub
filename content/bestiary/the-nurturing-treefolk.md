# The Nurturing Treefolk

*Medium plant, neutral good*

## Physical Description
The Nurturing Treefolk resembles a humanoid figure formed entirely of living wood, bark, and foliage. Its "skin" is rough bark with patterns resembling a face on what serves as its head. Small flowers and moss grow in patches across its body, and its fingers extend into branch-like digits. A gentle, earthy scent surrounds it, and tiny glowing spores occasionally drift from its form.

> Standing still among the trees, the treefolk is nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings—only the subtle movement of its chest-like trunk expanding and contracting with breath, and the occasional blinking of eyes formed from amber sap, betrays its true nature.

## Lore
**Guardians of Sacred Groves**
Nurturing Treefolk are often born from trees that have absorbed magic over centuries in druidic groves or fey-touched forests. They serve as guardians and caretakers of these special places, tending to the needs of plants and animals alike.

**Peaceful Protectors**
Unlike many sentient plants, Nurturing Treefolk are generally peaceful and avoid conflict when possible. However, they will defend their territories fiercely when threatened, particularly against those who would harm the natural world.

> *When a Nurturing Treefolk reaches the end of its long life, it plants itself in fertile soil and becomes a tree once more, often growing into a magnificent specimen that serves as a focal point for natural magic.*

***Spellcasting.*** The treefolk is a 5th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 13). The treefolk has the following druid spells prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): *druidcraft*, *guidance*, *thorn whip*
* 1st Level (4 slots): *entangle*, *faerie fire*, *goodberry*
* 2nd Level (3 slots): *barkskin*, *flame blade*

***Nurturing Touch (1/Day).*** Melee weapon attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: The target's hit point maximum is increased by 10 (3d6) if it is a living creature of plant origin.

***Earthbind Growth (1/Day).*** As a bonus action, one tree within 60 feet grows one size larger and twists its roots into an obstacle. A creature must make a DC 13 Strength (Athletics) check to move through the space without slowing down, or a DC 13 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to move through the space without falling.

**Branch Slam.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d10 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

## Tactics
The Nurturing Treefolk prefers to avoid direct confrontation, instead using its spells to control the battlefield. It typically begins combat by casting *entangle* to restrict enemy movement, followed by *plant growth* to further hamper mobility. It uses Earthbind Growth to create obstacles and protect itself or allies. In melee, it relies on its Branch Slam attack while using *flame blade* when facing enemies resistant to bludgeoning damage.

> As the treefolk retreats, small seedlings sprout in its footsteps, a final gift to the forest it has sworn to protect.
