# Iridescent Moth

*Small beast, unaligned*

## Physical Description
Iridescent Moth is a stunning creature with wings that shimmer with an almost supernatural array of colors. Its wingspan reaches about two feet across, and its body is covered in fine, luminescent scales that seem to change color depending on the angle of light. Its antennae are unusually long and appear to glow faintly in darkness.

> In the dim light of the forest, the moth's wings pulse with colors that shouldn't exist in nature—blues deeper than the ocean, purples richer than royal velvet, and golds that outshine the sun itself.

## Lore
**Magical Origins**
Iridescent Moth is believed to be the result of ordinary moths being exposed to wild magic or fey influence over generations. They are most commonly found in enchanted forests or areas with strong connections to the Feywild.

**Collectors' Prize**
The scales of these moths are highly prized by alchemists and enchanters for their magical properties. A single intact wing can fetch a high price in certain markets, leading to unfortunate hunting of these rare creatures.

***Blinding Camouflage (1/Day).*** As an action, the moth surrounds itself with a flurry of luminescent, colorful dust that forms a 20-foot radius sphere. The sphere is difficult terrain, and any creature that enters the sphere for the first time on its turn must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of their next turn. The dust disperses after 1 minute.

***Swarm.*** If the moth is subjected to an attack that would deal 10 damage or less, that damage is instead distributed evenly among any number of creatures within 5 feet of the moth, and the moth is unharmed.

## Tactics
Iridescent Moth typically uses its Blinding Camouflage ability when threatened, creating a cloud of disorienting dust to escape predators. It rarely engages in direct combat, preferring to flee to safety. When in groups, these moths instinctively use their Swarm ability to protect themselves, distributing damage among nearby creatures.

> As the moth flies away, tiny motes of colorful light trail behind it, hanging in the air like stars fallen from the night sky.
