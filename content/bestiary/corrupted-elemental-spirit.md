# Corrupted Elemental Spirit

*Large elemental, chaotic evil*

## Physical Description
The Corrupted Elemental Spirit appears as a twisted, malformed manifestation of elemental energy. Its form shifts between solid and fluid states, with tendrils of corrupted energy lashing out from its core. Dark veins of pollution run through its body, and it emits an unnatural aura that seems to warp and distort the environment around it.

> Where a pure elemental would flow with natural grace, this corrupted spirit writhes and contorts as if in constant pain, its essence stained with an otherworldly taint that seems to leach into everything it touches.

## Lore
**Tainted Origins**
Corrupted Elemental Spirits are the result of elemental entities that have been exposed to powerful sources of corruption—often from the Far Realm, demonic influence, or magical pollution. What was once a neutral force of nature becomes a destructive entity driven by pain and rage.

**Environmental Harbingers**
The presence of a Corrupted Elemental Spirit often indicates a serious environmental problem in the area. They are drawn to sites of magical contamination or planar disruption, sometimes serving as unwitting guardians of dangerous locations.

> ##### Elemental Corruption
> *The corruption of an elemental is not merely a physical transformation but a fundamental perversion of its nature. What was once a being of pure elemental harmony becomes a discordant force that seeks to spread its corruption to all it encounters.*
> — Mordenkainen's Discourse on the Elements

## Tactics
The Corrupted Elemental Spirit relies on its elemental abilities to control the battlefield. It uses Elemental Growth to intimidate opponents and increase its reach, while its Corruption Aura weakens other elementals that might oppose it. In combat, it targets spellcasters first, recognizing them as the greatest threat to its existence. It uses Elemental Destruction to remove cover and obstacles that might protect its enemies.

> As the corrupted spirit moves, it leaves behind a trail of tainted elemental energy that slowly seeps into the ground, a lingering reminder of the unnatural force that has passed through.
