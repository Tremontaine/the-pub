# Willowisp

*Tiny undead, chaotic evil*

## Physical Description
A willowisp appears as a softly glowing orb of pale, bluish-white light about the size of a human fist. This spectral illumination pulses gently, sometimes dimming to a faint glimmer before brightening again with unnerving intensity. No physical form exists within or behind the light—it is a purely ethereal manifestation. Occasionally, faint whispers or distant cries seem to emanate from the willowisp, and those who look directly at it for too long sometimes report seeing fleeting faces within the glow, mouths open in silent screams.

> *A soft, hypnotic light hovers above the marshy ground, its pale blue-white glow reflecting off the stagnant water below. It bobs gently as if carried by an unfelt breeze, sometimes dimming to near-invisibility before flaring back to an alluring brilliance. As it drifts closer, the temperature drops noticeably, and you hear what might be whispered voices carried on the chill air—pleading, warning, or perhaps enticing you forward.*

## Lore
**Lost Souls.** Willowisps are believed to be the souls of those who died in sorrow, desperation, or with unfinished business. Most commonly, they form in desolate places—swamps, moors, misty forests, and abandoned battlefields where tragic deaths occurred.

**Deceptive Guides.** The primary hunting strategy of a willowisp is to mimic a distant lantern or campfire, luring travelers off safe paths and into dangerous terrain such as quicksand, hidden sinkholes, or areas where more dangerous predators lurk. Some have learned to imitate cries for help or the sounds of children's laughter to further entice compassionate victims.

**Essence Feeders.** Willowisps sustain themselves by consuming life essence. Unlike vampires or wraiths that drain life force directly, willowisps feed on the final moments of a dying creature's life, absorbing the energy released as the soul departs the body. This is why they prefer to lead victims to dangerous situations rather than attack directly.

**Unquiet Reflections.** Some scholars theorize that willowisps aren't truly sentient undead but rather psychic impressions left by traumatic deaths—echoes of final moments replaying endlessly. Others believe they're manifestations of elements of the deceased's personality, particularly strong emotions like desperation or malice.

> ##### Marsh Guide's Warning
> *"Three rules for surviving the moors after dark: First, never follow a light you didn't bring yourself. Second, if you hear someone calling your name, walk the other way. Third, if you feel suddenly cold and sad for no reason, start running and don't stop until you're out of the mist. The wisps can't chase you far—they're bound to where their bodies lie beneath the mud."*

***Ephemeral.*** The willowisp can't wear or carry anything.

***Incorporeal Movement.*** The willowisp can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

***Variable Illumination.*** The willowisp sheds bright light in a 5- to 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional number of feet equal to the chosen radius. The willowisp can alter the radius as a bonus action.

***Actions***

***Soul Drain.*** *Melee Spell Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. *Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 2) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution save or lose 1d4 hit dice. The target regains these hit dice after completing a long rest. If this reduces a creature to 0 hit dice, the creature gains one level of exhaustion.

## Tactics
Willowisps prefer to avoid direct confrontation, instead using their Variable Illumination and flight to lure victims into dangerous situations. They are patient hunters, sometimes following potential prey for hours or even days. When forced into combat, they use their incorporeal nature to move through obstacles and attack from unexpected directions. A willowisp typically targets the weakest-looking member of a group first, hoping to isolate them from their companions. When seriously threatened, they dim their light completely and flee, using their superior darkvision to navigate while effectively invisible to most pursuers.

> *The willowisp hovers just at the edge of the treeline, its glow pulsating in a strangely rhythmic pattern that draws your attention despite your best efforts to look away. As you watch, it seems to take on a vaguely humanoid shape for just a moment—an outstretched hand, perhaps, or a nodding head, beckoning you toward the darkness beyond. The air grows colder the longer you stare, and an inexplicable sense of melancholy settles over you like a shroud.*
