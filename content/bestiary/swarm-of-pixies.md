# Swarm of Pixies

*Large fey, chaotic good*

## Physical Description
A swarm of pixies appears as a shimmering cloud of tiny humanoid forms, each standing no taller than 6 inches. Individual pixies have delicate dragonfly or butterfly wings that catch the light in iridescent flashes of color. Their features are elfin and beautiful, with hair in vibrant, unnatural colors like lavender, teal, or rose gold. When agitated, the entire swarm pulses with a multicolored glow that shifts between hues according to their collective mood—golden for joy, red for anger, blue for sorrow. The sound of hundreds of tiny voices laughing, arguing, or singing creates a musical tinkling like wind chimes in a gentle breeze. Trails of glittering dust fall from their wings as they move, temporarily imbuing the air with unpredictable fairy magic.

> *Swirling tempest of laughter and mischief, the Swarm of Pixies overwhelms foes with sleep-tipped arrows, enchantments, and chaotic magic. Their collective power turns pranks into peril.*

> *A whirling vortex of colorful light swarms through the clearing, hundreds of tiny winged humanoids moving in perfect coordination while somehow maintaining an appearance of absolute chaos. Their collective laughter rings like countless tiny bells, punctuated by flashes of arcane light as magic dances between their miniature hands. The very air sparkles where they pass, ordinary objects momentarily transforming, levitating, or changing color in their wake.*

## Lore
**Collective Consciousness.** While individual pixies have distinct personalities, a swarm develops a temporary group consciousness that directs their actions. This collective mind is still chaotic and mischievous but displays intelligence and coordination far beyond what individual pixies could achieve.

**Defenders of Fey Realms.** Despite their diminutive size and playful nature, pixie swarms are formidable defenders of fey territories. They particularly focus their protective efforts on boundaries between the Feywild and Material Plane, faerie rings, ancient groves, and places where the veil between worlds is thin.

**Magical Mayhem.** The magical capabilities of pixies increase exponentially when they gather in swarms. Their accumulated fairy dust can temporarily warp reality, causing unpredictable transmutations, enchantments, or illusions that may persist long after the swarm has departed.

**Seasonal Gatherings.** Pixie swarms most commonly form during significant seasonal events—solstices, equinoxes, or rare celestial alignments. During these times, normally solitary pixies feel compelled to gather, creating swarms that may persist for days or weeks before dissolving back into individuals.

> ##### Fey Researcher's Journal
> *"The common perception of pixies as mere tricksters drastically underestimates their potential threat when gathered en masse. I've witnessed a swarm strip an ogre to bone in minutes with their tiny arrows, turn an aggressive hydra into a garden of flowering toadstools, and enchant an entire village into dancing for three days without rest. Their chaotic nature makes them unpredictable allies at best, catastrophic forces of nature at worst."*

***Magic Resistance.*** The swarm has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Swarm.*** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa. It can move through openings as small as 1 inch wide. The swarm can't regain HP or gain temporary HP.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The swarm's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13). The swarm can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

- At will: *druidcraft*, *dancing lights*
- 3/day each: *confusion*, *entangle*, *sleep*
- 1/day each: *polymorph*, *greater invisibility*

***Actions***

***Multiattack.*** The swarm makes two Tiny Arrows attacks or casts one spell.

***Tiny Arrows.*** *Ranged Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, range 20/60 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (3d6) piercing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution save or fall unconscious for 1 minute. The target wakes if it takes damage or another creature uses an action to shake it awake.

***Fey Dust (Recharge 5–6).*** The swarm exhales a shimmering dust in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom save or be charmed or frightened (swarm's choice) for 1 minute. Affected creatures can repeat the save at the end of each turn.

## Legendary Actions
The swarm can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The swarm regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Distracting Flutter.*** Each creature in the swarm's space must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity save or have disadvantage on its next attack roll.

***Misty Escape (Costs 2 Actions).*** The swarm transforms into mist and moves up to 30 feet without provoking attacks. It reforms in an unoccupied space.

***Whirlwind (Costs 3 Actions).*** The swarm spins violently. Creatures in its space must make a DC 13 Strength save. On a failure, they take 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone.

## Tactics
A swarm of pixies fights with surprising coordination and cunning. They typically begin combat by using their Fey Dust ability to charm or frighten the most physically imposing threats. They position themselves to occupy the same space as multiple enemies, using their Distracting Flutter legendary action to hinder counterattacks. The swarm targets spellcasters with sleep spells to eliminate magical threats, then uses their Tiny Arrows against remaining opponents. If seriously threatened, they use Misty Escape to reposition, potentially becoming Greater Invisible before launching a new assault. A swarm of pixies understands when it's outmatched and will retreat rather than face destruction, but may return later with unexpected allies or a new strategy.

> *The air fills with a melodic humming as hundreds of tiny voices join in harmony. The swarm moves as a single entity despite being composed of countless individuals, forming intricate patterns that seem to bend the light around them. As they focus their attention, their collective glow intensifies, and the very fabric of reality seems to ripple in their wake. What would be harmless mischief from a single pixie becomes a force of nature when hundreds act as one.*
