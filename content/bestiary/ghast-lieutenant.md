# Ghast Lieutenant

*Medium undead, neutral evil*

## Physical Description
The Ghast Lieutenant is a more powerful variant of the common ghast, with decaying flesh that emits a foul stench. Its body is gaunt but muscular, with elongated claws dripping with necrotic energy. The creature's eyes glow with malevolent intelligence, and it often wears tattered remnants of the armor it wore in life.

> The air grows thick with the stench of decay as the ghast lieutenant emerges from the shadows, its yellowed teeth bared in a grotesque smile as it surveys potential prey.

## Lore
**Undead Commanders**
Ghast Lieutenants are created when particularly strong-willed or militarily accomplished individuals are transformed by necromantic energy. Unlike common ghouls or ghasts, they retain much of their tactical acumen and leadership abilities from life.

**Ghoulish Hierarchy**
In the undead pecking order, Ghast Lieutenants serve as field commanders for larger groups of ghouls and ghasts. They maintain enough intelligence to execute complex battle plans and coordinate their lesser kin in organized attacks.

> *"The common ghoul is but a mindless beast, driven by hunger. The ghast possesses a cruel cunning. But beware the ghast lieutenant, for it remembers the strategies of war and leads its brethren with terrible purpose."*

***Stench.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the ghast lieutenant must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the creature is poisoned until the start of its next turn. On a successful save, the creature is immune to the stench of all ghouls for 24 hours.

**Multiattack.** The ghast lieutenant makes two claw attacks.

**Claw.** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d4 + 4) slashing damage, plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. If the target is a living creature, it must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**Paralyzing Touch.** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. The target must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Tactics
The Ghast Lieutenant uses its superior intelligence to coordinate attacks with other undead. It typically sends lesser ghouls to engage enemies first, then moves in to use its paralyzing abilities on those who seem most dangerous. Once enemies are paralyzed, it focuses its claw attacks on them to eliminate threats efficiently. It will retreat if outmatched, preserving itself to fight another day—a tactical awareness uncommon among lesser undead.

> As the last of the adventurers fell to the ground, paralyzed and helpless, the ghast lieutenant's raspy laughter echoed through the crypt. It gestured to its lesser kin, who moved forward with terrible purpose toward their immobilized prey.
