# Ratling Eldritch General

*Medium humanoid (ratfolk), chaotic evil*

## Physical Description
The ratling eldritch general stands over six feet tall with an imposing, martial bearing. Unlike most ratlings, it stands fully upright, its posture disciplined and commanding. Clad in ornate full plate armor that has been modified to accommodate its ratlike features, the general's equipment displays craftsmanship far superior to the crude weaponry of common ratlings. Its fur is sleek and well-groomed, often dyed in patterns denoting rank and accomplishments. The general's eyes glow with an uncanny intelligence, displaying none of the feral madness common to its kind. Arcane runes are etched into its armor and weapons, occasionally flaring with magical energy when it issues commands. A cape made from the pelts of fallen enemies or rival ratlings often completes its imposing silhouette.

> *The ratling commander strides forward with unexpected grace, its movements betraying years of martial training. Unlike its more bestial kin, intelligence and cold calculation shine in its eyes. Its armor bears the scars of countless battles, yet each piece is meticulously maintained and adorned with glowing runes of power. When it speaks, its voice carries not just the harsh chittering typical of its race, but authoritative tones that compel obedience from lesser ratlings and strike unease in the hearts of enemies.*

## Lore
**Masters of Warfare.** Eldritch generals represent the pinnacle of ratling military leadership, combining martial prowess with arcane enhancement and tactical brilliance. They have typically risen through the ranks by demonstrating not just strength but cunning, often eliminating rivals through carefully orchestrated "accidents" rather than direct confrontation.

**Arcane Augmentation.** Unlike the unstable mutations of arcane abominations, eldritch generals undergo carefully controlled magical enhancement rituals designed to preserve their mental faculties while granting them supernatural abilities. These procedures involve binding elemental energies to their life force, often through the use of rare crystals implanted beneath their skin.

**Strategic Visionaries.** Ratling eldritch generals are among the few members of their species capable of long-term planning. They coordinate complex military campaigns spanning months or even years, sometimes forging temporary alliances with other underground races to achieve their objectives. Their tactics often involve misdirection, using lesser ratlings as diversions while elite forces strike at truly valuable targets.

**Jealous of Authority.** The position of eldritch general is highly coveted in ratling society, and those who attain it guard their status zealously. They surround themselves with personally loyal troops and eliminate potential rivals before they become threats. Many generals have their own alchemists and shamans who answer directly to them rather than to the ratling hierarchy, ensuring their continued access to the substances that maintain their enhanced abilities.

> ##### Tactical Evolution
> *"Reports from the northern settlements describe coordinated ratling attacks unlike anything we've seen before. Multiple diversionary strikes preceding a main assault. Tunneling operations targeting our water supplies. Systematic destruction of alarm systems before larger forces engage. Someone is teaching these vermin actual military strategy, and that should terrify us far more than their numbers ever could."*

***Battle Command.*** The general can use a bonus action to direct one ally within 60 feet that can hear it to make one weapon attack as a reaction.

***Magic Resistance.*** The general has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the general can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the general. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. The effect ends if the general is incapacitated.

***Tactical Genius.*** The general has advantage on initiative rolls. Additionally, allied ratlings within 30 feet of the general have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.

***Multiattack.*** The general makes three melee attacks with its longsword.

***Longsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage, or 16 (2d10 + 5) slashing damage if used with two hands.

***Arcane Burst (Recharge 5–6).*** The general releases a burst of arcane energy in a 30-foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw, taking 45 (10d8) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Command Rally (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The general rallies its forces with a commanding shout. All allied ratlings within 60 feet that can hear the general gain 25 temporary hit points and advantage on attack rolls until the end of the general's next turn.

## Tactics
The ratling eldritch general coordinates the battlefield, positioning itself where it can direct as many allies as possible with Battle Command and Leadership. It begins combat by using Command Rally to boost its forces, then engages the most threatening enemy commanders or spellcasters while directing troops to handle other threats. The general uses Arcane Burst when surrounded or when multiple enemies are clustered together, and saves at least one use of Battle Command each round to redirect allies to the most critical targets. Unlike lower ratlings, the general values strategic victory over personal glory and will retreat if doing so preserves its forces for a future engagement.

> *The general surveys the battlefield with calculating eyes, signaling complex commands to its subordinates with precise gestures. Where it directs, ratling forces move with surprising coordination, focusing fire and exploiting weaknesses in enemy formations. A nimbus of arcane energy builds around the general as it raises its sword, and with a commanding shout that carries supernatural weight, it infuses its troops with new vigor before turning its attention to the enemy leadership.*
