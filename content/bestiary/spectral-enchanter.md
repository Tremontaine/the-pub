# Spectral Enchanter

*Medium undead, neutral evil*

## Physical Description
The Spectral Enchanter appears as a translucent, hovering figure with an ethereal glow emanating from within. Its form shifts and wavers like smoke caught in a gentle breeze, occasionally revealing glimpses of what might have once been a powerful mage. Arcane runes and symbols float around its spectral body, pulsing with otherworldly energy.

> Wisps of ethereal energy trail behind it as it glides through the air, and its eyes burn with an unnatural intelligence and malevolence.

## Lore
**Origin of the Spectral Enchanter**
Spectral Enchanters are the remnants of once-powerful arcane practitioners who refused to relinquish their magical knowledge even in death. Through forbidden rituals or tragic magical accidents, these mages have transcended the boundary between life and death, becoming undead entities tethered to the Material Plane by their insatiable hunger for arcane power.

**Pursuit of Knowledge**
Even in undeath, Spectral Enchanters continue their obsessive pursuit of magical knowledge. They haunt ancient libraries, magical academies, and forgotten repositories of arcane lore. Some actively seek out living mages to drain their essence and absorb their magical abilities.

> ##### Whispers of the Damned
> *The Spectral Enchanter doesn't simply kill its victims—it consumes their very essence, absorbing their memories and magical knowledge. Those who fall to its ethereal touch become hollow shells, their minds emptied of all they once knew.*
> — Magister Valeria Thorne, Arcanist of the Silver Conclave

***Ethereal Insight (Recharge 5-6).*** The Spectral Enchanter taps into the ethereal plane to gain insight into its enemies. Until the end of its next turn, it has advantage on attack rolls, spell attack rolls, and ability checks, and other creatures have disadvantage on saving throws against its spells and abilities.

**Ethereal Touch.** Melee Spell Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d10) necrotic damage. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest. The target dies if this effect reduces its hit point maximum to 0.

**Ethereal Drain (Recharge 4-6).** The Spectral Enchanter targets one creature it can see within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The Spectral Enchanter regains hit points equal to the damage dealt.

**Ethereal Grasp (3/day).** The Spectral Enchanter reaches out with an ethereal hand at a creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 18 Strength saving throw, or be restrained. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.

## Legendary Actions
The Spectral Enchanter can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Spectral Enchanter regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Touch (Costs 1 Action).** The Spectral Enchanter makes one Ethereal Touch attack.

**Spellcasting (Costs 1 Action).** The Spectral Enchanter casts a cantrip.

**Ethereal Burst (Costs 2 Actions).** The Spectral Enchanter unleashes a burst of ethereal energy. Each creature within 15 feet of the Spectral Enchanter must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 10 (3d6) force damage.

**Ethereal Drain (Costs 3 Actions).** The Spectral Enchanter uses its Ethereal Drain.

## Tactics
The Spectral Enchanter begins combat by using Ethereal Insight to gain advantage against its foes. It prefers to stay at range, using its custom spells like Spectral Orb and Ectoplasmic Web to control the battlefield while draining enemies with Ethereal Drain. When cornered, it uses Ghostly Step to escape to the Ethereal Plane. Against powerful spellcasters, it prioritizes Counterspell to negate magical threats. The Spectral Enchanter reserves Wail of the Banshee and Spirit Guardians of the Elders for when it's surrounded by multiple enemies.

> As the Spectral Enchanter is defeated, its form dissolves into wisps of ethereal energy, a final haunting whisper echoing in the minds of those nearby: "Knowledge... eternal... I shall return..."
