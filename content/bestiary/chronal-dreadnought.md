# Chronal Dreadnought

*Huge construct, unaligned*

## Physical Description
The Chronal Dreadnought is a massive construct covered in intricate, arcane patterns that pulse with an eerie blue light. Its most striking feature is a large, glowing orb set into its chest, which serves as the source of its temporal powers. The construct's frame is built of impossibly dense metal that seems to shimmer slightly out of phase with reality.

> Time bends around the massive construct as it advances, each thunderous step seeming to echo both before and after it actually occurs.

## Lore
Chronal Dreadnoughts are enigmatic constructs imbued with the power to manipulate time itself. Their origin is a mystery, but scholars believe they were created by a long-lost civilization that had mastered the secrets of temporal magic.

**Ancient Guardians**: These hulking machines are often found guarding ancient ruins or important artifacts, their purpose programmed into them long ago by their mysterious creators. Some say they are waiting for a specific event or person, biding their time until their true purpose is revealed.

**Temporal Anomalies**: Regions where Chronal Dreadnoughts operate often experience strange temporal phenomena. Clocks run at different speeds, plants grow or wither unnaturally, and people report experiencing déjà vu or premonitions.

> ##### The Timeless Sentinels
> *We found the construct standing perfectly still in the center of the ruins, as if it had been there for millennia. Our chronometer spells failed the moment we entered its presence. When Magister Valen attempted to examine it, the thing suddenly activated—and I swear by all the gods, I saw Valen die three different ways before time seemed to settle on a single outcome.*

***Immutable Form.*** The dreadnought is immune to any spell or effect that would alter its form.

***Magic Resistance.*** The dreadnought has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Siege Monster.*** The dreadnought deals double damage to objects and structures.

***Temporal Stasis.*** The dreadnought is immune to effects that would manipulate time, such as the slow spell.

**Multiattack.** The dreadnought makes two slam attacks.

**Slam.** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or have its speed reduced by 10 feet until the end of its next turn.

**Temporal Cannon (Recharge 5-6).** The dreadnought fires a beam of temporal energy in a 120-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 55 (10d10) force damage and is flung 1d4 × 10 feet in a random direction and knocked prone. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't flung or knocked prone.

**Chronal Shift (1/Day).** The dreadnought bends time around itself, allowing it to take an additional turn immediately after its current turn ends. Any effects that would end at the end of its turn persist until the end of this additional turn.

## Reactions

**Temporal Rebound.** When the dreadnought takes damage from a melee attack, it can use its reaction to force the attacker to reroll the damage and take the new result.

## Tactics
A Chronal Dreadnought is a formidable foe that uses its temporal abilities to control the battlefield. It begins combat by using its Temporal Cannon to scatter and damage enemies. It then closes in to make slam attacks, using its Chronal Shift if it needs to make a decisive move or escape a dangerous situation.

The Dreadnought is smart enough to target spellcasters and other high-priority targets with its attacks. It uses its Temporal Rebound to punish melee attackers and to increase its already impressive durability.

If the tide of battle turns against it, the Dreadnought will attempt to use its Chronal Shift to buy time for reinforcements to arrive or to make a strategic retreat. It fights to the end to protect whatever it has been programmed to guard.
