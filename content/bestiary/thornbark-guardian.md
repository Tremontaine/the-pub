# Thornbark Guardian

*Medium plant, neutral*

## Physical Description
Standing about 7 feet tall, a thornbark guardian resembles a humanoid figure crafted entirely from gnarled wood and thick bark. Its limbs are sturdy like oak branches, covered in rough, overlapping plates of bark that serve as natural armor. Sharp, wooden thorns protrude from its joints, shoulders, and knuckles. The guardian's face is a crude approximation of humanoid features—hollows for eyes that glow with a faint amber light and a jagged split for a mouth. Deep root-like structures extend from its feet when it stands still, allowing it to draw sustenance directly from the soil.

> *A massive figure of twisted bark and jutting thorns stands motionless among the ancient trees, nearly indistinguishable from its surroundings until it slowly turns its head. Amber light flickers from within hollow eye sockets, and the earth trembles slightly as roots momentarily extend and retract beneath its feet.*

## Lore
**Ancient Wardens.** Thornbark guardians are created by powerful druids or fey entities to protect sacred groves and important woodland sites. Some arise naturally in forests with strong connections to primal magic, manifesting as defenders against threats to the ecological balance.

**Patient Sentinels.** A thornbark guardian can remain motionless for years, rooting itself in place and entering a dormant state while maintaining vigilant watch. They are particularly patient creatures, content to stand guard for generations if necessary.

**Collective Intelligence.** While individually of low intelligence, thornbark guardians in proximity to one another can form a collective awareness through their root systems. This network allows them to coordinate defense strategies and alert others to threats across a wide area of forest.

**Living Architecture.** In some ancient elven communities, thornbark guardians were cultivated as both protectors and living structures. These communities developed methods to shape the guardians' growth into archways, watchtowers, and defensive walls that could animate when danger threatened.

> ##### Forest Warden's Insight
> *"The thornbarks don't hate civilization—they hate imbalance. I've seen them ignore woodcutters who took only what they needed and replanted afterward. But when that logging company tried to clear-cut the north grove, the guardians uprooted themselves by the dozen. The loggers' camp was... well, there's a reason we don't go to that part of the forest anymore."*

***Plant Camouflage.*** The guardian has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in terrain with vegetation.

***Regeneration.*** The guardian regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn if it is in contact with soil. If the guardian takes fire damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the guardian's next turn.

***Actions***

***Thorn Slam.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage plus 4 (1d6) piercing damage.

***Entangling Roots (Recharge 5–6).*** The guardian causes roots to erupt in a 15-ft. radius. The area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute. Each creature in that area when the roots appear must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be restrained. A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another entangled creature within reach on a success.

## Tactics
Thornbark guardians begin combat by using their Entangling Roots to immobilize threats, focusing first on spellcasters or those carrying sources of fire. They then methodically attack restrained creatures with their Thorn Slam. When defending important sites, guardians work in pairs or larger groups, with some engaging directly while others position themselves to create overlapping fields of entangling roots. They are fearless in defense of their assigned territories but rarely pursue fleeing intruders beyond the boundaries they protect.

> *The forest floor erupts with writhing roots as the thornbark guardian awakens from its vigil. What appeared to be just another ancient tree now moves with deliberate purpose, each thunderous step causing new shoots to burst from the soil. Its wooden limbs creak and groan as it advances, thorns gleaming in the dappled sunlight filtering through the canopy.*
