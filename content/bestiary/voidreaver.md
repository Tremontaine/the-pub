# Voidreaver, Harbinger of Oblivion

*Huge outsider, chaotic evil*

## Physical Description
The Voidreaver towers over most beings, its massive form shrouded in a cloak of swirling darkness that seems to devour light. Its body appears partially translucent, revealing glimpses of cosmic energy and distant stars within its form. Massive claws extend from elongated limbs, capable of tearing through reality itself. Its face is a nightmarish visage—a shifting mass of void energy with piercing eyes that burn with the cold fire of dying stars.

> The air grows heavy and distorted as reality itself seems to bend around the creature's presence. Stars visible through the tear in space flicker and die as the Voidreaver emerges, bringing with it the cold promise of oblivion.

## Lore
**Origin of the Void**
The Voidreavers are ancient entities that exist in the spaces between planes, drawn to reality by powerful magical disturbances or deliberate summoning. They are believed to be fragments of the primordial chaos that existed before the multiverse took form, given sentience and purpose through unknown cosmic events.

**Harbingers of Destruction**
Wherever a Voidreaver appears, catastrophe follows. They are drawn to centers of magical power, feeding on arcane energies and leaving devastation in their wake. Some scholars believe they serve a greater cosmic purpose—culling worlds that have grown too powerful or magically unstable.

**Cultists of Oblivion**
Throughout history, nihilistic cults have formed around the worship of these entities, seeking to hasten their arrival through elaborate rituals. These cultists believe that the Voidreavers will usher in a new age of existence beyond the constraints of reality as we know it.

> ##### The Void Prophecies
> *"When the stars align and the Weave grows thin, the Harbingers shall emerge from the darkness between worlds. Their coming heralds not an end, but a transformation—reality unmade and reborn through the crucible of chaos."*
> — From the forbidden text "Whispers of the Void"

***Legendary Resistance (4/day).*** If Voidreaver fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** Voidreaver's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 20). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: 

* At will: power word stun, power word pain  
* 3/day each: power word kill, power word blind
* 1/day each: power word heal

***Aura of Chaos (1/round at initiative count 20).*** The creature emanates an aura of raw, chaotic energy in a 120-foot radius. At initiative count 20, roll a d10 on the Chaos Surge table to determine the effect for that round. The effect applies to all creatures within the aura.

**Chaos Surge Table**

1. **Gravity Flux**: Gravity within the aura intensifies, reducing movement speed by half and making jumping impossible until the start of the next round.
2. **Gravity Void**: Gravity within the aura diminishes, causing all creatures to float. Attacks have disadvantage due to unstable footing until the start of the next round.
3. **Reality Ripple**: Each creature's position is swapped with an illusionary double at a random location within the aura.
4. **Temporal Distortion**: Time within the aura stutters. Each creature may take an extra bonus action on their turn, but can't take reactions until the start of the next round.
5. **Elemental Flux**: The elements within the aura become unstable. Each creature can choose one type of damage (fire, cold, lightning, acid, or thunder) at the start of their turn. Until the start of the next round, they have resistance to that damage type but vulnerability to a different random type.
6. **Wild Magic Surge**: The Weave of magic quivers. Any spell cast within the aura triggers a roll on the Wild Magic Surge table (PHB p.104), but the effects are less harmful and more chaotic.
7. **Dimensional Tear**: At the start of each creature's turn, they can choose to step through a portal. They disappear and reappear at the start of their next round in a random location within the aura.
8. **Mute Field**: Sound within the aura is completely absorbed, making verbal communication or command impossible until the start of the next round.
9. **Blurry Field**: The air within the aura becomes distorted, causing all creatures to have disadvantage on perception checks and ranged attack rolls until the start of the next round.
10. **Ability Null**: A random ability (Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) is suppressed for each creature until the start of the next round. During this time, the creatures cannot use abilities, spells, or features that require that specific ability.

***Reality Tear.*** As a bonus action, Voidreaver tears a hole in reality in a 30-ft cube within 120 ft. Each creature in the area must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, taking 25 (5d10) force damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

***Multiattack.*** Voidreaver makes two claw attacks.

***Claws.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 18 (2d10 + 8) slashing damage plus 15 (2d10) necrotic damage.

***Nebula Beam (Recharge 4-5).*** Voidreaver channels the destructive energy of a collapsing star, unleashing a beam of astral energy in a 60-foot line that is 10 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 45 (10d8) force damage and is subjected to the *grappled* condition as they are caught in the beam's gravitational pull until the start of Voidreaver's next turn. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't grappled.

***Cry of the Void (Recharge 6).*** Voidreaver emits a terrifying, otherworldly howl that echoes from the void. Each creature within 60 feet of Voidreaver must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (5d8) thunder damage and 22 (5d8) psychic damage, and is *frightened* until the end of its next turn as the howl reverberates within its psyche. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't frightened.

***Possess Corpse.*** Voidreaver can fully possess a corpse or creature with CR 8 or less, or 10 HD or less, within 5 feet of it. Voidreaver disappears from its physical form and controls the body. It has access to its own statistics, except for its size and speed, and can use its Innate Spellcasting while possessing a body. It can use an action to return to its physical form in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the possessed creature. If Voidreaver goes more than 3 days without possessing a creature, it is banished back to its home plane for 3d4 weeks.

## Legendary Actions
Voidreaver can take 3 legendary actions per round, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. Voidreaver regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

* **Move:** Voidreaver moves up to its speed.
* **Claw Attack:** Voidreaver makes one claw attack.
* **Nebula Beam (Costs 2 Actions):** Voidreaver uses its Nebula Beam.  
* **Cry from the Void (Costs 3 Actions):** Voidreaver uses its Cry of the Void.
* **Power Word (Costs 2 Actions):** Voidreaver utters a power word spell of its choice.

## Tactics
The Voidreaver begins combat by positioning itself to catch as many foes as possible in its Nebula Beam or Cry of the Void. It uses Reality Tear to separate clustered enemies and relies on its Aura of Chaos to create battlefield chaos. Against powerful spellcasters, it prioritizes using power word spells to neutralize threats. If severely wounded, it may attempt to possess a nearby corpse to escape or gain tactical advantage. The Voidreaver is intelligent enough to focus its attacks on the most dangerous opponents first, particularly those who can banish or bind it.

> As the Voidreaver begins to fade, its form dissolves into wisps of dark energy that spiral back toward the tear in reality from which it emerged. The air shimmers with residual chaos as the laws of physics slowly reassert themselves, but those who witnessed its presence know that the boundaries between worlds have been forever weakened in this place.
