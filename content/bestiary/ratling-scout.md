# Ratling Scout

*Small humanoid (ratfolk), chaotic neutral*

## Physical Description
A ratling scout stands about 3 to 4 feet tall, with a hunched posture and twitching movements that betray its rodent heritage. Its body is covered in short, coarse fur ranging from dirty brown to mottled gray, with a long, hairless tail that constantly whips about behind it. The ratling's face is distinctly rat-like, with a pointed snout, whiskers that quiver with every scent, and large, dark eyes that gleam with a mixture of intelligence and feral instinct. Sharp incisors protrude from its mouth, and its hands end in small but wickedly sharp claws.

> *The creature emerges from the shadows, its nose twitching rapidly as it scents the air. Small but quick, it moves with the darting, unpredictable motions of a cornered rat, yet there is unmistakable purpose in its movements. Its beady eyes scan for threats as its clawed hands grip crude weapons, ready to strike or flee in an instant.*

## Lore
**Urban Scavengers.** Ratling scouts thrive in the underbellies of cities and settlements, making their homes in sewers, abandoned buildings, and forgotten tunnels. They are opportunistic by nature, scavenging what they need and taking advantage of the refuse and discarded treasures of larger civilizations. Their knowledge of urban environments is unparalleled, as they memorize every pipe, forgotten passage, and hidden entrance.

**Pack Hunters.** Though individually weak, ratling scouts are rarely encountered alone. They operate in packs, using numbers and coordination to overcome stronger opponents. Their natural instinct for pack tactics makes them dangerous when they surround prey, as they know exactly when to strike for maximum effect. A lone ratling might seem timid, but it is likely just the first of many.

**Information Traders.** Ratling scouts often serve as the eyes and ears of their tribes, gathering intelligence about potential threats or opportunities. Some scouts have been known to trade information with other underground factions or even surface dwellers, exchanging secrets for safety or supplies. Their ability to move unnoticed makes them excellent spies.

**Survival Specialists.** Ratlings have thrived in harsh conditions for generations, developing keen senses and heightened awareness of their surroundings. Their enhanced sense of smell allows them to detect danger well before others might notice it, and their ability to squeeze through tight spaces enables them to escape from almost any trap.

> ##### Underground Networks
> *"Don't underestimate the ratling network. They may look like simple vermin to you, but they have eyes and ears everywhere. Something happens in the sewers of Waterdeep, and two days later ratlings in Baldur's Gate are chattering about it. Gods know how they communicate so efficiently, but coin a few and you'll have informants in places no human spy could ever reach."*

## Tactics
Ratling scouts avoid direct confrontation when possible, preferring to observe from hiding and report back to their warren. When forced to fight, they use their Pack Tactics ability to surround isolated targets, darting in to attack and then using Nimble Escape to retreat to safety. They prioritize their own survival over all else and will flee if seriously wounded, using their knowledge of local tunnels and passages to lose pursuers.
