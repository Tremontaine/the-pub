# Ratling Scout

*Small humanoid, unaligned*

## Physical Description
Ratling Scouts are small, wiry humanoid rat-like creatures with sharp claws and teeth. Their fur is patchy, and their eyes gleam with cunning intelligence. They move swiftly and quietly, often blending into the shadows of their environment.

> *A small, hunched figure emerges from the shadows, its beady eyes glinting with malice. It screeches, revealing sharp teeth, and its claws flex in anticipation of a fight.*

## Lore

**Stealthy Predators.** Ratling Scouts are the vanguard of ratling groups, often sent ahead to scout and gather information. They are adept at moving unseen and use their keen sense of smell to track prey or detect intruders.  

**Pack Hunters.** These creatures rarely operate alone, relying on their pack for protection and strength. Their natural instincts make them dangerous in groups, as they coordinate attacks to overwhelm their enemies.

> *"Never underestimate a ratling scout. They may seem weak, but their strength lies in numbers and their ability to strike from the shadows."*
