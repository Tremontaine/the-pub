# Ratling War Matriarch

*Huge monstrosity, chaotic evil*

## Physical Description
The ratling war matriarch is a monstrous aberration that dwarfs all other ratlings, her massive form having grown to terrifying proportions through a combination of selective breeding, magical enhancement, and parasitic infestation. Standing fifteen feet tall when fully upright, her swollen body combines ratlike features with insectoid elements—multiple pairs of arms, some ending in massive claws, others in more dexterous appendages capable of wielding weapons or casting spells. Her lower body extends into a segmented, almost centipede-like form with multiple legs, allowing surprising mobility despite her bulk. The matriarch's head retains recognizable ratling features, though grotesquely enlarged, with multiple eyes arranged in clusters and mandibles framing her rat-like maw. Her skin is a patchwork of fur, chitin plates, and exposed flesh pulsing with eggs that occasionally birth smaller ratlings that scurry across her body before dropping to the ground.

> *The chamber trembles as the massive creature shifts her bulk, multiple limbs moving with unsettling coordination. Her swollen body glistens in the torchlight, chitinous plates sliding against each other as she raises herself to full height. Dozens of eyes swivel independently, assessing threats and opportunities with cold calculation. Smaller ratlings scurry around and even upon her body, attending to her needs with religious devotion. When she speaks, her voice comes not just from her mouth but seems to emanate from multiple points along her body, as if multiple minds exist within her grotesque form.*

## Lore
**Living Hive Queens.** War matriarchs serve as the reproductive centers for entire ratling warrens, producing hundreds of offspring each year. Unlike normal female ratlings, matriarchs are capable of asexual reproduction, though they often maintain harems of male consorts whose genetic material may be selectively incorporated to create specialized offspring. Their bodies are living incubators, constantly producing ratlings with various traits useful to the colony.

**Magical Savants.** Despite their monstrous appearance, war matriarchs possess intellects far superior to most ratlings and considerable magical aptitude. They typically master multiple schools of magic, with particular emphasis on divination (to monitor threats to their warrens), conjuration (to summon allies), and necromancy (to recycle the bodies of fallen ratlings into undead servants).

**Command through Telepathy.** War matriarchs maintain telepathic links with their offspring, allowing them to coordinate activities throughout their territory without verbal communication. This hivemind-like connection grows stronger with proximity, enabling matriarchs to directly control the actions of nearby ratlings in combat situations.

**Ancient and Patient.** While most ratlings live relatively short lives, war matriarchs can survive for centuries, growing larger and more powerful with age. The oldest matriarchs are said to remember the fall of ancient human empires and may harbor grudges that span generations. Their long-term planning often involves goals that will not be realized until decades after they set their plans in motion.

> ##### The Grand Matriarch
> *"Deep beneath the Underdark, there is said to exist the Grand Matriarch—a war matriarch of such immense size that she occupies an entire cavern system, her body having fused with the very stone of the earth. They say she has lived for a thousand years, producing tens of thousands of offspring that now populate warrens throughout the world. Every ratling you've ever encountered might ultimately trace its lineage back to her bloated, eternal form."*

***Hive Command.*** The matriarch can use a bonus action to grant a creature within 60 feet of it advantage on its next attack roll or saving throw.

***Birth Brood (Recharge 5–6).*** The matriarch spawns 1d4+1 ratling scouts (CR 1) in unoccupied spaces within 5 feet of her. These ratlings act on the matriarch's initiative and obey her telepathic commands. They remain for 1 hour or until slain.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the matriarch fails a saving throw, she can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** The matriarch has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Regeneration.*** The matriarch regains 10 hit points at the start of her turn. If she takes fire or acid damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of her next turn. The matriarch dies only if she starts her turn with 0 hit points and doesn't regenerate.

***Spellcasting.*** The matriarch is an 18th-level spellcaster. Her spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 19, +11 to hit with spell attacks). She has the following wizard spells prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): *acid splash, mage hand, minor illusion, prestidigitation, ray of frost*
* 1st level (4 slots): *detect magic, mage armor, magic missile, shield*
* 2nd level (3 slots): *detect thoughts, mirror image, misty step*
* 3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, fireball, haste*
* 4th level (3 slots): *dimension door, greater invisibility, polymorph*
* 5th level (3 slots): *cloudkill, hold monster, wall of force*
* 6th level (1 slot): *chain lightning, disintegrate*
* 7th level (1 slot): *teleport, finger of death*
* 8th level (1 slot): *maze*
* 9th level (1 slot): *meteor swarm*

***Multiattack.*** The matriarch makes three melee attacks: one with her bite and two with her claws.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (3d10 + 6) piercing damage plus 13 (3d8) poison damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the target can't regain hit points. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d10 + 6) slashing damage.

***Psychic Lash (Recharge 5–6).*** The matriarch unleashes a burst of psychic energy. Each creature of the matriarch's choice within 60 feet must make a DC 19 Intelligence saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, a creature is also stunned until the end of its next turn.

## Tactics
The ratling war matriarch begins combat by using Birth Brood to create minions that can act as a buffer between herself and enemies. She then positions herself at the optimal distance to use both spells and melee attacks, preferring to target spellcasters with Counterspell while directing her minions against physical threats. The matriarch uses her Hive Command ability to enhance her most powerful minions at critical moments, and saves powerful spells like Disintegrate and Meteor Swarm for when enemies are clustered together. If seriously threatened, she will use Dimension Door or Teleport to escape, taking her most valuable offspring with her and abandoning the rest.

> *The matriarch's countless eyes narrow as she assesses the threat, her massive body pulsing as several small ratlings burst forth from bulging sacs along her flanks. With silent telepathic commands, she directs her brood even as arcane energy builds around her many limbs. The smaller ratlings move with perfect coordination, forming patterns that seem random but clearly serve some greater tactical purpose that only the matriarch's vast intelligence can comprehend.*
