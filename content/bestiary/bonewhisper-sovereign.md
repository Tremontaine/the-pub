# Bonewhisper Sovereign

*Medium undead, lawful evil*

## Physical Description
The Bonewhisper Sovereign is a regal undead entity whose form blends skeletal elegance with ethereal darkness. Its bones are polished to an ivory sheen and adorned with intricate runes that pulse with necrotic energy. Wisps of shadow flow around its frame, occasionally coalescing into a spectral crown above its skull. Its eye sockets burn with an intense purple flame that seems to pierce through both flesh and soul.

> Whispers follow in its wake, echoing the final words of those whose souls it has claimed. The air grows cold and still in its presence, as if death itself has paused to pay respect.

## Lore
**Origin of Power**
The Bonewhisper Sovereign was once a powerful necromancer who sought immortality through forbidden rituals. Rather than achieving true immortality, the necromancer transformed into this undead entity, retaining consciousness and magical prowess while transcending the limitations of mortal flesh.

**Domain of Influence**
The Sovereign rules over a small domain of undead, commanding loyalty through a combination of magical domination and the promise of protection from those who would destroy undead indiscriminately. Its territory is often marked by subtle signs: withered plants, unusually quiet wildlife, and the occasional whisper heard when no one is speaking.

> ##### The Sovereign's Bargain
> *"I offer not life eternal, but purpose eternal. Your bones shall never rest idle in the dirt, but serve with dignity in my court of shadows."*
> â€” The Bonewhisper Sovereign to a dying warrior

***Undead Nature.*** The Bonewhisper Sovereign doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The Bonewhisper Sovereign's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18). The Sovereign can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

At will: *command, detect magic, dispel magic, ray of enfeeblement*
3/day each: *animate dead, blight, confusion*
1/day each: *circle of death, dominate person*

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the Bonewhisper Sovereign fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
