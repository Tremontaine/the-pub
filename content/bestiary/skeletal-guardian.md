# Skeletal Guardian

*Medium undead, lawful evil*

## Physical Description
The Skeletal Guardian stands at attention with perfect military posture, clad in a tarnished breastplate and wielding an ancient shield. Unlike common skeletons, its bones are reinforced with dark metal bands inscribed with protective runes. Its skull features a distinctive helm-like crest, marking it as part of the Sovereign's elite guard. Small motes of purple light flicker within its eye sockets, scanning constantly for threats.

> It moves with surprising precision and discipline, the result of martial training that has persisted beyond death. Each step is measured, each stance defensive, as it fulfills its eternal duty.

***Undead Nature.*** The Skeletal Guardian doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

***Loyal Defender.*** When the Bonewhisper Sovereign is within 60 feet of the Skeletal Guardian, the guardian gains a +2 bonus to AC and saving throws.

**Longsword.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage, or 8 (1d10 + 3) slashing damage if used with two hands.

**Shield Bash.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d4 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature of Medium size or smaller, it must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or be pushed 5 feet away from the guardian.

**Protective Interception.** When a creature the Skeletal Guardian can see targets the Bonewhisper Sovereign with an attack and the guardian is within 5 feet of the Sovereign, the guardian can use its reaction to become the target of the attack instead.

## Tactics
Skeletal Guardians are disciplined protectors that position themselves between threats and the Bonewhisper Sovereign. They work in pairs when possible, using their shield bashes to keep enemies at bay. If the Sovereign is directly threatened, they will use their Protective Interception ability without hesitation, sacrificing themselves to protect their master.
