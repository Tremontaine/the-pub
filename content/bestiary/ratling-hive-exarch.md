# Ratling Hive Exarch

*Huge monstrosity, chaotic evil*

## Physical Description
The ratling hive exarch is a horrifying fusion of ratling biology, demonic essence, and technological enhancement that towers over its lesser kin. Standing fifteen feet tall, its massively muscled form combines ratlike features with demonic elements—its skin is a deep crimson interspersed with black, chitinous plates that serve as natural armor. Six arms extend from its torso—the upper pair ending in massive, serrated blades, the middle pair bearing more traditionally ratlike claws enhanced with metal reinforcements, and the lower pair equipped with integrated magical weapons that pulse with elemental energy. Its head retains recognizable ratling features, though grotesquely enlarged and adorned with multiple sets of horns that form a crown-like structure. Its eyes burn with hellfire, and when it speaks, its voice carries the harmonics of a dozen tortured souls. Steam occasionally vents from ports in its shoulders and back, and runic circuitry embedded in its flesh pulses with malevolent energy that responds to its emotional state.

> *The massive creature crashes forward, each step causing the ground to tremble. Steam hisses from vents embedded in its crimson hide as it towers over all around it, six arms moving with terrible purpose. Its face combines ratlike features with demonic aspects—multiple sets of horns forming a grotesque crown above eyes that burn with the fires of some infernal realm. The scent of brimstone and heated metal fills the air around it, and when it roars, the sound carries layers of tortured screams beneath its dominant voice. The runic circuitry embedded in its flesh pulses with increasing intensity as it focuses its attention, arcane energy crackling between the metal plates integrated into its massive frame.*

## Lore
**Weapons of Conquest.** Hive exarchs represent the ultimate ratling war machines—beings specifically created to lead armies in conquest of the surface world. Each exarch is the product of horrific magical and technological experimentation, combining ratling flesh with demonic essence and mechanical enhancements to create entities of unprecedented destructive capability.

**Infernal Pact Manifestations.** The creation of a hive exarch involves complex pacts with infernal entities, typically requiring the sacrifice of thousands of victims to provide sufficient energy. The demons or devils involved in these pacts contribute essence that is physically integrated into the exarch's form, granting it supernatural abilities beyond normal ratling capability.

**Walking Arsenals.** Each exarch is equipped with an array of weapons—both biological and crafted—that are physically integrated into its form. These typically include natural weapons enhanced with magical properties, mechanical devices that harness elemental forces, and unique magical implements created specifically for the exarch's use. These integrated weapons cannot be disarmed or separated from the exarch without destroying significant portions of its body.

**Generals of Apocalypse.** Exarchs serve as field commanders for the largest and most destructive ratling armies, coordinating massive campaigns aimed at conquering or destroying surface civilizations. They are deployed only for major offensives, as their very existence represents an enormous investment of resources and magical energy. The appearance of an exarch on the battlefield typically signals the beginning of a campaign of unprecedented scale and ambition.

> ##### The Reforging
> *"The subject experiences pain beyond mortal comprehension during the transformation. We begin by infusing the ratling host—always selected from the strongest warriors—with alchemical compounds that cause rapid muscle growth and bone density enhancement. As the body expands, we surgically integrate mechanical components and demonic essence simultaneously, binding them to the host's flesh with chains of binding both physical and magical. Nine out of ten candidates die screaming during this process. Those who survive emerge as something new—neither fully ratling, nor demon, nor construct, but a terrible fusion of all three."*

***Unyielding Will.*** The exarch has advantage on saving throws against being charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and stunned.

***Magic Resistance.*** The exarch has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Aura of Madness.*** The exarch emits an aura within a 30-foot radius. Any creature within this aura must make a DC 25 Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of its turns or be driven mad for 1 minute. While mad, the creature moves and attacks randomly. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Regeneration.*** The exarch regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.

***Siege Monster.*** The exarch deals double damage to objects and structures.

***Integrated Weapons (Recharge 5–6).*** The exarch activates the magical weapons integrated into its lower arms, choosing one of the following effects:
- **Flame Cannon:** The exarch unleashes a line of fire 60 feet long and 10 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 26 Dexterity saving throw, taking 72 (16d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Lightning Projector:** The exarch fires a bolt of lightning at a creature it can see within 120 feet. The target must make a DC 26 Dexterity saving throw, taking 88 (16d10) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning then jumps to up to three additional targets within 30 feet of the first target. Each additional target must make the same saving throw against the same damage.

***Hellfire Breath (Recharge 5-6).*** The exarch exhales a cone of hellfire in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 26 Dexterity saving throw, taking 91 (26d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Integrated Spellcasting.*** The exarch's spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 24). The exarch can innately cast the following spells, requiring no components:
- At will: *detect magic, dispel magic*
- 3/day each: *wall of fire, fireball, lightning bolt*
- 1/day each: *meteor swarm, incendiary cloud, chain lightning*

## Legendary Actions
The exarch can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The exarch regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Claw.*** The exarch makes one claw attack.

***Command Minion.*** The exarch commands one ratling creature within 60 feet to make a melee attack against a target of its choice.

***Terrifying Roar (Costs 3 Actions).*** The exarch emits a terrifying roar. Each creature of its choice within 120 feet that can hear it must succeed on a DC 25 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Tactics
The ratling hive exarch begins combat with Hellfire Breath to damage as many enemies as possible, then closes to melee range where its numerous attacks and Aura of Madness can have maximum effect. It uses Integrated Weapons strategically—employing the Flame Cannon against clustered enemies and the Lightning Projector against powerful single targets, particularly spellcasters. The exarch coordinates with allied ratlings using Command Minion, directing them to engage enemies that would otherwise flank or surround it. It saves Terrifying Roar for when it needs to break enemy morale or force a retreat. The exarch fights with brutal efficiency, prioritizing the destruction of the strongest opposition first, and shows no concern for casualties among its own forces as long as victory is achieved.

> *The massive exarch surveys the battlefield with calculating malevolence, steam venting from its armored hide as its internal mechanisms surge with power. With shocking speed for its size, it charges forward, multiple arms striking in coordinated patterns that leave little room for defense or escape. The runes etched into its flesh pulse with increasing intensity as it channels infernal energy through its integrated weapons, unleashing elemental fury upon its enemies. When it roars, the sound breaks more than morale—weak-willed creatures fall to their knees, minds temporarily shattered by the psychic weight of its presence.*
