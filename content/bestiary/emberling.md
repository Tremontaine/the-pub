# Emberling

*Tiny elemental, neutral*

## Physical Description
An emberling is a diminutive fire elemental, barely larger than a songbird. Its core resembles a lump of glowing coal or a small flame, which pulses and flickers with life. Wispy tendrils of smoke and spark form vague wing-like appendages that allow it to float and fly with surprising agility. The emberling's body constantly shifts between deep red, bright orange, and occasionally blue hues, with its intensity changing with its mood. Tiny embers trail behind it as it moves, quickly burning out before they reach the ground. Despite its small size, the emberling radiates noticeable warmth in about a foot radius.

> *A tiny mote of living flame hovers at eye level, its core pulsing like a heartbeat of molten coal. Spark-like wings flicker and reform constantly as it darts about with hummingbird-like movements, leaving a brief trail of glowing embers that fade into wisps of smoke before touching the ground.*

## Lore
**Elemental Sparks.** Emberlings are among the smallest of fire elementals. Some scholars believe they form spontaneously in areas where the barrier between the Material Plane and the Elemental Plane of Fire is thin. Others suggest they're actually fragments of larger fire elementals that have developed independent consciousness.

**Collective Warmth.** Though they can survive individually, emberlings naturally gather in groups called kindlings. These collections of dozens or even hundreds of emberlings can generate significant heat and light, sometimes being mistaken for larger fire elementals from a distance.

**Magical Catalysts.** Emberlings are drawn to sources of magic, particularly fire magic. Their presence can amplify fire-based spells, sometimes in unpredictable ways. Some wizards deliberately cultivate relationships with emberlings to enhance their spellcasting, though this practice isn't without risk.

**Living Lanterns.** In certain cultures, particularly among fire genasi and salamander communities, emberlings are respected as minor elemental spirits rather than merely magical beasts. Some emberlings willingly serve as living light sources in exchange for exotic fuels or protection.

> ##### Wizard's Warning
> *"An emberling makes a charming familiar—until it decides your spellbook looks like an interesting source of fuel. Keep them well-fed with aromatic oils and tiny chunks of coal dusted with sulfur, and NEVER let them near your component pouches. I've lost three perfectly good wands to their curious appetites."*

## Tactics
Emberlings rely on their small size and flight ability to avoid direct combat. When threatened, they maintain distance while using their Cinder Spark attack. They instinctively avoid water and sources of cold damage. When in groups, emberlings coordinate surprisingly well, attacking from multiple angles and retreating in patterns designed to confuse predators. If seriously threatened, emberlings will seek escape routes toward heat sources or upward into the air where larger creatures might have difficulty following.

> *The emberling flits about erratically, its tiny form pulsing with excitement as it investigates the warm campfire. It spirals upward with the rising heat, then dives playfully through the flames, growing momentarily brighter. At the sudden movement of your hand, it freezes midair, its glow intensifying as it prepares to either flee or defend itself with surprising ferocity for such a small creature.*
