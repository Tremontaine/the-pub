## Traits

**Keen Smell.** The swarm has advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on smell.
**Swarm.** The swarm can occupy another creature's space and vice versa, and the swarm can move through any opening large enough for a Tiny rat. The swarm can't regain hit points or gain temporary hit points.
**Rat King's Thrall.** When within 120 feet of a rat king, the swarm acts on the rat king's initiative and obeys its telepathic commands. If the rat king dies, the swarm disperses and flees.

## Actions

**Bites.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +2 to hit, reach 0 ft., one target in the swarm's space. *Hit:* 7 (2d6) piercing damage, or 3 (1d6) piercing damage if the swarm has half of its hit points or fewer. The target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or contract a disease. Until the disease is cured, the target can't regain hit points except by magical means, and the target's hit point maximum decreases by 3 (1d6) every 24 hours. If the target's hit point maximum drops to 0 as a result of this disease, the target dies.
