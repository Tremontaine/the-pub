# Pact of the Eternally Bound

*Medium swarm, any alignment*

## Physical Description
The Pact of the Eternally Bound appears as a group of ten humanoid spellcasters moving in perfect unison. Their eyes glow with an otherworldly light, and arcane energy crackles between them, forming visible threads that connect each member to the others. When they cast spells, their voices merge into a single, resonant tone that seems to echo from multiple sources simultaneously.

> "They moved not as individuals but as facets of a single entity. Their hands rose in unison, their voices blended into one, and the air itself seemed to bend to their collective will."

## Lore
**Origins of the Pact**
The Pact of the Eternally Bound is formed when a group of spellcasters willingly enter into a magical contract that binds their souls together. This ritual is typically performed in times of great need or desperation, when individual power is insufficient to overcome a threat.

**Purpose and Power**
The members of the Pact sacrifice their individuality for collective strength. Once bound, they can no longer act independently, but gain access to powers far beyond what any could achieve alone. The ritual that creates the Pact is ancient and rare, known only to those who have dedicated their lives to the study of soul magic.

> ##### Words of Warning
> *"To enter the Pact is to surrender self for strength. It is not a decision to be made lightly, for once bound, you are never truly alone again—even in death."*
> — Elzorn the Wise

***Bound As One.*** The Pact functions as a single creature. The Pact shares hit points and saving throws. When the Pact's hit points are reduced to 0, all members of the pact are defeated. The Pact cannot be targeted by spells or effects that target a single creature.

***Magic Resistance.*** The Pact has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Spellcasting.*** The Pact is a 10th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). The pact can cast spells without limitation of spells per day, but each spell can only be cast once per round. The Pact knows the following spells:

Cantrips (at will): *fire bolt, light, prestidigitation, shocking grasp*
1st level (4 slots): *magic missile, shield, witch bolt*
2nd level (3 slots): *invisibility, misty step, scorching ray*
3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, fireball, fly*
4th level (3 slots): *greater invisibility, ice storm, wall of fire*
5th level (2 slots): *cone of cold, wall of force*

***Pact Tactics.*** The Pact has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the Pact's allies is within 5 feet of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

***Bound by Pain.*** When the Pact takes damage, the damage is equally distributed among all pact members. When a pact member's hit points are reduced to 0, that member is defeated. The total hit points of the Pact reduce by 10% for each defeated member.

**Multiattack.** The Pact makes two spell attacks.

**Touch.** Melee Spell Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 14 (4d6) necrotic damage.

**Power of the Pact (Recharge 5-6).** The Pact casts a single spell that normally requires concentration and can maintain concentration on it without requiring concentration, allowing the Pact to cast another concentration spell at the same time.

## Legendary Actions
The Pact can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Pact regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

**Spell Attack (Costs 2 Actions).** The Pact makes a spell attack.

**Shimmering Defense (Costs 1 Action).** The Pact gains a +2 bonus to AC until the start of its next turn.

**Regroup (Costs 3 Actions).** The Pact redistributes any damage taken among its members, potentially reviving defeated pact members. The Pact's total hit points increase by 10% for each revived member. The Pact's hit points cannot exceed its hit point maximum.

## Tactics
The Pact prefers to stay at a distance, using their spells to control the battlefield and deal damage while keeping their enemies at bay. They use their **Power of the Pact** ability to maintain concentration on powerful spells like *wall of force* or *greater invisibility*, while still being able to cast other concentration spells.

The Pact uses their **Bound by Pain** feature to distribute damage among themselves, keeping all their members alive for as long as possible. If a member of the Pact is defeated, they use their **Regroup** legendary action to redistribute damage and bring them back into the fight.

When cornered or facing a particularly tough opponent, the Pact uses their **Shimmering Defense** legendary action to increase their Armor Class, making them harder to hit.

> "The pact is not just an agreement. It is a bond, a union of souls forever entwined in the cosmic tapestry. When you face the pact, you face not one, but all."
