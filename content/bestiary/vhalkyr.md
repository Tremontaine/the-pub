# Vhalkyr, Herald of the Void

*Large aberration, chaotic evil*

## Physical Description
The Vhalkyr is a massive, otherworldly entity with a form that seems to constantly shift between solidity and incorporeality. Its body appears as a twisted amalgamation of void-black flesh and swirling cosmic energy. Massive claws extend from elongated limbs, and its maw is filled with teeth that seem to absorb light rather than reflect it. Occasional ripples of planar instability cause parts of its form to momentarily discorporate, revealing glimpses of the infinite void beyond.

> The air grows cold as reality itself seems to tear at the seams. Through this wound in existence emerges the Vhalkyr, its very presence an affront to the natural order.

## Lore
**Herald of Cosmic Entropy**
The Vhalkyr serves as a harbinger for entities that exist beyond the known planes. These cosmic horrors send forth their heralds to prepare worlds for their eventual arrival, weakening the barriers between dimensions and sowing chaos among mortal civilizations.

**Void Speakers**
Though the Vhalkyr cannot speak in conventional terms, they communicate through devastating void words—utterances that bend reality and inflict various effects upon those unfortunate enough to hear them. Scholars theorize that these words are fragments of a language so ancient and powerful that even a single syllable can alter the fabric of existence.

**Planar Anomalies**
Where a Vhalkyr walks, reality becomes unstable. Plants wither, animals flee, and sensitive individuals experience nightmares and visions of cosmic horror. After prolonged exposure to a region, permanent tears in the planar fabric may form, allowing lesser void creatures to slip through.

> ##### The Void Codex
> *"In my research, I have identified eight void words commonly utilized by the Vhalkyr. Each represents a fundamental concept of unmaking—annihilation, banishment, subversion, crushing, draining, enervation, terror, and weakening. Should you hear these words, your fate is likely already sealed."*
> — Archmage Keldorn, last surviving member of the Planar Defense Council

***Legendary Resistance (3/day).*** If the vhalkyr fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** The vhalkyr has advantage on saving throws against spells and magical effects.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The vhalkyr's innate spellcasting ability is Charisma. It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

* At will: detect magic, dispel magic
* 3/day: globe of invulnerability  
* 1/day: imprisonment

***Planar Instability.*** At the start of each of the vhalkyr's turns, roll a d6. On a 1, its form partially discorporates, imposing disadvantage on all of its attack rolls until the end of its turn.

**Multiattack.** The vhalkyr makes two attacks: one with its bite and one with its claws.

**Bite.** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 17 (2d10 + 6) piercing damage.

**Claws.** Melee Weapon Attack: +11 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d6 + 6) slashing damage. 

**Howling Void (Recharge 5-6).** The vhalkyr releases a deafening howl in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or take 44 (8d10) thunder damage and be stunned until the end of the vhalkyr's next turn.

## Legendary Actions

The vhalkyr can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The vhalkyr regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

* **Move.** The vhalkyr moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

* **Claw Attack.** The vhalkyr makes one claw attack.

* **Void Word (Costs 2 Actions).** The vhalkyr utters a void word, targeting one creature it can see within 60 feet that has not been subjected to this void word already. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or be affected based on the void word used:

  - **Annihilate.** Take 55 (10d10) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

  - **Banish.** Be banished to the Void Plane for 1 minute on a failed save. While banished, the target's speed is 0, and it is incapacitated. At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw to return to the space it occupied before being banished. If the creature's original space is occupied, the creature appears in the nearest unoccupied space.

  - **Subvert.** Become charmed by the vhalkyr for 1 minute on a failed save. While charmed, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against the vhalkyr and ability checks and saving throws to act against its wishes.

  - **Crush.** Take 44 (8d10) force damage and be knocked prone on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

  - **Drain.** Reduce the target's hit point maximum by 20 (this reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest) on a failed save.

  - **Enervate.** Reduce the target's Strength and Dexterity scores by 4 each (to a minimum of 1) for 1 hour on a failed save.

  - **Fear.** Become frightened of the vhalkyr for 1 minute on a failed save. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

  - **Weaken.** Reduce the target's hit point maximum by 10 (this reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest) and its Strength and Constitution scores by 2 each (to a minimum of 1) for 1 hour on a failed save.

## Tactics
The Vhalkyr begins combat by identifying the most powerful spellcasters and attempting to neutralize them with its Void Words, particularly using Banish or Subvert. It uses its flight ability to maintain tactical advantage, staying out of reach of melee combatants while using its Howling Void when enemies cluster together. The creature reserves its Legendary Resistance for saving throws against effects that would significantly impair its mobility or offensive capabilities. When facing multiple opponents, it focuses on isolating and eliminating targets one by one, using its Void Words strategically to disable the most threatening foes first.

> As the Vhalkyr fades back into the void between worlds, the air shimmers with residual energy. Those who survived its onslaught are left with the unsettling certainty that they have glimpsed only a fraction of the horrors that await beyond the veil of reality.
