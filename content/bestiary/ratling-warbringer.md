# Ratling Warbringer

*Medium humanoid (ratfolk), chaotic evil*

## Physical Description
The ratling warbringer stands just over six feet tall, its powerful frame bulging with unnatural muscle mass. Unlike the typical hunched posture of its kin, it carries itself with brutal confidence, its movements displaying trained precision despite occasional twitches and spasms. Its fur is sparse and reveals skin covered in ritual scarification, crude tattoos, and metal studs embedded directly into its flesh. The warbringer's face combines ratlike features with something more bestial—jaws elongated to accommodate oversized fangs, ears notched and pierced with metal rings, and eyes that burn with malevolent intelligence. It typically wears patchwork armor fashioned from scavenged pieces, adorned with grisly trophies from previous conquests.

> *The massive ratling steps into the torchlight, its movement a disturbing blend of animal savagery and calculated precision. Metal studs glint from flesh marked by countless battle scars, and its greatsword—crude but massive—drags behind it, leaving a groove in the stone floor. A low growl emanates from its throat as it surveys potential targets, its eyes reflecting the torchlight with an unnatural, almost hypnotic glow that seems to pulse in rhythm with an unheard cadence.*

## Lore
**Elite Warriors.** Warbringers represent the pinnacle of ratling military might—veteran warriors who have survived countless battles and undergone extensive alchemical and magical enhancement. They serve as field commanders for ratling war bands, directing lesser troops with surprising tactical acumen while personally engaging the most dangerous threats.

**Alchemically Enhanced.** Unlike berserkers, whose enhancements sacrifice intellect for strength, warbringers undergo more refined procedures that preserve their mental faculties while still dramatically increasing their physical capabilities. The process involves consuming rare alchemical compounds, exposure to magical radiation, and surgical implantation of metal fragments believed to channel arcane energy.

**Aura of Insanity.** The same procedures that grant warbringers their enhanced capabilities also connect them to chaotic energies from beyond the material plane. This connection manifests as an aura that can temporarily shatter the mental coherence of nearby creatures, causing confusion and hallucinations that give the warbringer a significant advantage in combat.

**Symbols of Authority.** In ratling society, warbringers command respect and fear in equal measure. They typically lead from the front, inspiring lesser ratlings through displays of personal strength and brutality. Their position is never secure, however, as ambitious subordinates constantly plot to usurp them, leading warbringers to regularly cull potential rivals.

> ##### The Cost of Power
> *"The transformation is excruciating—I've seen candidates claw their own eyes out from the pain. Those who survive emerge stronger, faster, and more vicious than any normal ratling could ever be. But there's a price beyond the physical torment. The metal fragments embedded in their flesh slowly poison their bodies, giving them perhaps five years of enhanced power before organ failure claims them. They know this, and it makes them all the more dangerous—they have nothing to lose."*

***Battle Frenzy.*** When the warbringer reduces an enemy creature to 0 hit points, it can immediately make another weapon attack as a bonus action.

***Aura of Madness.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of the warbringer must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by the confusion spell until the start of its next turn.

***Brutal Critical.*** The warbringer can roll one additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

***Tactical Command.*** The warbringer can use a bonus action to direct an ally it can see within 30 feet. That ally can use its reaction to make one weapon attack with advantage.

***War Cry (Recharge 5–6).*** The warbringer lets out a terrifying battle cry. Each hostile creature within 30 feet that can hear it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Battle Surge (1/Day).*** The warbringer can take one additional action on its turn.

## Tactics
The ratling warbringer begins combat by using War Cry to frighten as many opponents as possible, then advances on the most dangerous enemies while directing allied ratlings to engage softer targets. It positions itself to maximize the effect of its Aura of Madness, ideally catching multiple enemies within range. The warbringer focuses attacks on a single target until it falls, triggering Battle Frenzy for additional attacks, and saves Battle Surge for critical moments when overwhelming offense is needed. Unlike berserkers, the warbringer fights with strategic purpose, targeting spellcasters and leaders when possible, and will retreat if doing so serves the greater ratling cause.

> *The warbringer raises its massive greatsword above its head and lets loose a cry that seems to carry echoes of madness itself. Its followers surge forward in response, their movements becoming more coordinated under its direction. With terrifying efficiency, the warbringer singles out the most threatening opponent, its movements precise and measured despite the feral rage burning in its eyes.*
