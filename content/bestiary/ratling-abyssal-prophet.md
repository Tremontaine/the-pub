# Ratling Abyssal Prophet

*Huge fiend, chaotic evil*

## Physical Description
The ratling abyssal prophet represents the most terrifying fusion of ratling and demonic essence, its form forever altered by direct communion with the darkest entities of the Abyss. Standing over fifteen feet tall, its body has been grotesquely transformed—its lower half resembles a massive, tentacled horror with dozens of writhing appendages that constantly shift and reform, while its upper body maintains a vaguely ratlike appearance, though stretched and distorted. Its skin has the texture of volcanic glass, with cracks that reveal churning abyssal energy beneath. Multiple faces occasionally form and dissolve across its torso—echoes of beings it has consumed or communed with. Its primary head retains ratlike features, though greatly distorted, with constantly shifting features and multiple sets of eyes that open and close randomly across its surface. When it speaks, the air itself seems to darken, and its words manifest both as sound and as crawling shadows that move across surfaces in the patterns of its speech.

> *The massive entity's approach is heralded by a wave of wrongness that disturbs reality itself—light dims, sounds become muffled, and the air grows thick with the scent of things that should not exist in the material world. Its lower body writhes with countless tentacles that leave glistening trails of otherworldly ichor, while its upper form twists and shifts as if struggling to maintain cohesion in this reality. The obsidian-like surface of its skin cracks and reforms constantly, revealing glimpses of the churning abyssal energies contained within. When it raises its arms, reality itself seems to tear around them, and the shadows cast by its form move independently of any light source, reaching out with hungry purpose toward all living things nearby.*

## Lore
**Abyss Touched.** Abyssal prophets begin as ratling cultists who achieve direct communion with demon lords or abyssal entities through forbidden rituals. This communion transforms them into something that exists simultaneously in multiple planes—their physical form anchored in the Material Plane, while their consciousness extends into the Abyss itself. This connection grants them unprecedented magical power but corrupts them beyond redemption.

**Living Portals.** Each prophet serves as a living conduit to the Abyss, capable of channeling both demonic entities and abyssal energy into the Material Plane. Their mere presence thins the barriers between worlds, causing reality to behave unpredictably in their vicinity. Extended exposure to an abyssal prophet can permanently corrupt an area, transforming it into a reflection of the abyssal realm the prophet is connected to.

**Prophets of Doom.** Abyssal prophets receive visions directly from the chaotic entities they serve, interpreting these incomprehensible glimpses into omens and prophecies that guide ratling society toward apocalyptic goals. These prophecies are often deliberately cryptic, allowing the prophet to claim fulfillment regardless of actual outcomes. However, when their predictions do manifest accurately, their influence among ratling kind grows exponentially.

**Reality Corruptors.** The most dangerous ability of the abyssal prophet is its capacity to permanently alter reality through extended ritual work. By channeling abyssal energy into specific patterns, they can change the fundamental laws of nature within an area—making water toxic, causing plants to grow with sentient malevolence, or allowing demons to manifest without summoning. Some prophets have transformed entire regions into miniature reflections of the Abyss.

> ##### The Communion Ritual
> *"The aspiring prophet is suspended above a portal to the Abyss, held in place by hooks piercing their flesh at thirteen sacred points. As they recite the Verses of Unmaking, their blood drips into the portal, creating a connection between their life essence and the targeted abyssal realm. If the ritual succeeds, a tendril of pure abyssal energy reaches up through the portal and enters the aspirant's body through every orifice simultaneously. Those who survive this moment of communion are forever transformed, their flesh becoming a vessel for abyssal power. Most aspirants are simply consumed, their screams echoing briefly before they are pulled bodily into the Abyss."*

***Unholy Presence.*** The prophet's presence warps reality. Within a 30-foot radius, all creatures except the Abyssal Prophet have disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws.

***Magic Resistance.*** The prophet has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Aura of Despair.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 30 feet of the prophet must make a DC 26 Charisma saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the prophet fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Reality Anchor.*** The prophet exists partially outside normal reality. It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object. Additionally, it has advantage on saving throws against effects that would banish it to another plane of existence.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The prophet's spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 26). The prophet can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

* At will: *detect magic, detect thoughts, dispel magic*
* 3/day each: *meteor swarm, gate, finger of death, plane shift*
* 1/day each: *wish, time stop, weird*

***Multiattack.*** The prophet makes four melee attacks: two with its claws and two with its tail.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 36 (6d8 + 9) slashing damage plus 22 (4d10) necrotic damage.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. Hit: 34 (4d10 + 9) bludgeoning damage plus 27 (6d8) fire damage.

***Tentacles.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +16 to hit, reach 25 ft., up to three targets. Hit: 28 (4d8 + 9) bludgeoning damage plus 18 (4d8) acid damage, and the target is grappled (escape DC 24). Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained and takes 18 (4d8) acid damage at the start of each of its turns.

***Void Shout (Recharge 5-6).*** The prophet releases a wave of necrotic energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 26 Constitution saving throw, taking 70 (20d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, a creature's maximum hit points are reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest.

***Reality Corruption (Recharge 6).*** The prophet warps reality in a 30-foot radius around itself. The area becomes difficult terrain for all creatures except the prophet. Additionally, at the start of each creature's turn while in the area, it must make a DC 26 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the creature takes 44 (8d10) psychic damage and is affected by the confusion spell until the start of its next turn.

## Legendary Actions
The prophet can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The prophet regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Claw Attack.*** The prophet makes one claw attack.

***Tail Sweep.*** The prophet makes one tail attack against each creature within 15 feet of it.

***Summon Fiend (Costs 2 Actions).*** The prophet magically summons one shadow demon that appears in an unoccupied space it can see within 60 feet. The demon acts on the prophet's initiative count and obeys its telepathic commands. The demon remains for 1 minute, until it or the prophet dies, or until the prophet dismisses it as a bonus action.

***Dark Prophecy (Costs 3 Actions).*** The prophet chooses one creature it can see within 60 feet. That creature must make a DC 26 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 55 (10d10) psychic damage and is cursed. While cursed, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws. The curse lasts until removed by a greater restoration spell or similar magic.

## Tactics
The ratling abyssal prophet begins combat by using Reality Corruption to disrupt enemy formations and tactics, then follows with Void Shout to weaken as many opponents as possible. It uses its innate spellcasting to devastating effect, reserving Meteor Swarm for clustered enemies and Finger of Death for particularly resilient foes. The prophet employs Tentacles to immobilize enemy spellcasters or leaders, while using Claw and Tail attacks against closer threats. It uses Summon Fiend to create distractions and additional threats, particularly targeting vulnerable backline combatants. The prophet fights with unholy intelligence, seeming to anticipate enemy moves before they occur, and will use plane shift to escape if seriously threatened, often taking important opponents with it to separate realms where it has the advantage.

> *The abyssal prophet moves with unsettling grace, its tentacled lower body propelling it forward while reality itself seems to buckle and warp in its vicinity. Shadows cast by normal light sources reach toward it as if drawn by some unseen force, and the very air darkens in concentric circles around its form. When it gestures, rifts momentarily open in the fabric of reality, offering horrifying glimpses into abyssal realms that no mortal mind was meant to comprehend. Its attacks come from multiple dimensions simultaneously, striking not just the body but the very soul of those who dare oppose its prophesied dominion.*
