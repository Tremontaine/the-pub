# Duskblade Assassin

*Medium fey, neutral evil*

## Physical Description
Duskblade Assassins are lithe, shadowy figures clad in form-fitting armor that seems to absorb light. Their features are sharp and predatory, with eyes that gleam like dying stars. Each carries an Eclipse Blade—a weapon that appears to be carved from solidified twilight, its edge constantly shifting between solid and incorporeal. Their movements are silent and fluid, leaving faint trails of shadow in their wake.

> "Where their blades pass, even memories fade"

## Lore
The Duskblade Assassins serve as the Twilight Sovereign's elite enforcers and hunters. Once twilight guardians who protected the boundaries between day and night, they were corrupted when the Sovereign claimed dominion over the gloaming hours. Now they hunt those who would bring light to the Sovereign's domain or who possess artifacts of dawn.

These assassins are feared throughout the planes for their ability to strike through solid barriers and their knack for appearing exactly when their target feels most secure. They collect shadows from their victims, storing them in crystalline vials as trophies and power sources for the Sovereign's rituals.

***Phasing Strike.*** The Duskblade Assassin can make one attack through solid objects up to 5 feet thick.

***Twilight Cloak.*** The Duskblade Assassin has 50% concealment in dim light or darkness, causing attack rolls against it to have disadvantage.

***Evasion.*** If the Duskblade Assassin is subjected to an effect that allows it to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, it instead takes no damage if it succeeds on the saving throw, and only half damage if it fails.

**Multiattack.** The Duskblade Assassin makes two Eclipse Blade attacks.

**Eclipse Blade.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 14 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) necrotic damage. If the target is in bright light, it is blinded until the end of its next turn.

**Shadow Ambush.** The Duskblade Assassin teleports up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space in a shadowed area as a bonus action. It can use this ability three times, and regains all expended uses when it finishes a short or long rest.

## Tactics
Duskblade Assassins prefer to strike from the shadows, using their Shadow Ambush ability to position themselves for maximum advantage. They target spellcasters and other light-bearers first, using their Phasing Strike to attack through walls or barriers when necessary.

When working in groups, they coordinate their attacks to flank enemies, with one assassin using its action to create areas of shadow that its allies can exploit with their Twilight Cloak ability. Against powerful foes, they retreat after striking, using hit-and-run tactics to wear down their opponents.

In service to the Twilight Sovereign, they often serve as advance scouts and elite guards, eliminating threats before they can reach their master.
