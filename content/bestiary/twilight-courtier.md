# Twilight Courtier

*Medium fey, neutral evil*

## Physical Description
Twilight Courtiers are elegant, spectral figures dressed in flowing garments that shimmer between deep purple and midnight blue. Their features are hauntingly beautiful yet tinged with melancholy, and their eyes reflect the dying light of sunset. Wisps of shadow trail behind them as they move with an otherworldly grace, and their laughter carries the bittersweet notes of endings.

> "Their laughter echoes with the sadness of last sunsets"

## Lore
Twilight Courtiers were once vibrant fey nobles who served in various courts throughout the Feywild. Seduced by the Twilight Sovereign's promises of eternal beauty preserved in the moment between light and dark, they surrendered their connections to dawn and growth, becoming embodiments of the fading day.

These courtiers maintain a mockery of noble etiquette, hosting elaborate balls and feasts in the Perpetual Gloaming. They lure mortals to these gatherings with enchanting music and whispers of secrets, only to drain them of hope and vitality to sustain their twilight existence.

> *"They dance without tiring, speak without breathing, and weep without tears. To join their revelry is to forget that time should move forward."*
> â€” From "Warnings of the Feywild," by Archmage Mordenkainen

***Crescendo of Dusk.*** When reduced to 0 hit points, the Twilight Courtier explodes in a burst of twilight energy. Each creature within 15 feet must make a DC 14 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one.

***Twilight Duet.*** When two or more Twilight Courtiers are within 10 feet of each other, they share damage (split evenly) and have advantage on saving throws.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The Twilight Courtier's spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 14):
- At will: *dancing lights*, *minor illusion*
- 3/day each: *charm person*, *misty step*
- 1/day: *hypnotic pattern*

**Shadow Dagger.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target.  
*Hit:* 10 (1d4 + 3 + 3d6) piercing plus psychic damage.

**Luring Whispers (Recharge 5-6).** The Twilight Courtier whispers enticing promises that reach into the minds of those who hear them. One creature the Courtier can see within 60 feet must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the target uses its reaction to move its full speed toward the Courtier by the most direct route, avoiding obvious hazards.

## Tactics
Twilight Courtiers prefer to work in pairs or larger groups to take advantage of their Twilight Duet ability. They use Luring Whispers to separate enemies from their allies, then attack with their Shadow Daggers. When seriously wounded, they position themselves near as many enemies as possible to maximize the effect of their Crescendo of Dusk explosion.

In service to the Twilight Sovereign, they often act as distractions or scouts, using their charm abilities to gather information or lure potential victims into ambushes.
