# Ratling Arcane Abomination

*Large monstrosity, chaotic evil*

## Physical Description
The arcane abomination represents the most grotesque outcome of ratling experimentation with forbidden magic. Standing nearly ten feet tall, its massively distorted form only vaguely resembles its ratling origins. Its body is asymmetrical and constantly shifting, with additional limbs, eyes, or mouths spontaneously forming and dissolving across its surface. The creature's fur has fallen out in patches, revealing skin that pulses with veins of glowing arcane energy. Crystalline growths protrude from its spine and shoulders, each containing swirling energies that cast eerie, shifting light across its surroundings. The abomination's face retains recognizable ratling features, though horribly distorted—multiple eyes of different sizes blinking out of sync, and a mouth that sometimes splits into several independent maws, each capable of speaking different words simultaneously.

> *The massive creature lurches forward, its form seeming to exist in multiple states at once. What might once have been a ratling has been twisted by magic beyond recognition, arcane energy crackling across its body as reality itself seems to warp around it. Crystalline growths pulsate with power as it moves, and the air fills with the scent of ozone and burned flesh. When it speaks, multiple voices emerge simultaneously, some words echoing before they're spoken, others delayed by seconds—a horrifying chorus of temporal distortion.*

## Lore
**Failed Ascension.** Arcane abominations are the result of ambitious ratling spellcasters attempting to transcend their physical limitations through dangerous magical rituals. These procedures typically involve infusing their bodies with raw arcane energy, consuming magical crystals, or forming pacts with entities from beyond the material plane. What begins as a quest for power inevitably results in uncontrolled mutation and mental degradation.

**Living Spell Conduits.** Despite their unstable condition, arcane abominations possess tremendous magical potential. Their bodies serve as living conduits for arcane energy, allowing them to cast spells with unusual potency. This power comes at a cost, however, as each spell cast accelerates their physical deterioration, leading many to burn out in spectacular magical detonations after particularly intense battles.

**Treated with Reverence.** Rather than rejecting these monstrosities, ratling society often treats them with a mixture of fear and reverence. They are seen as living proof of the transformative power of magic, and their unpredictable abilities make them valuable assets in warfare. Young ratling spellcasters study their mutations, hoping to replicate their power while avoiding their fate.

**Temporal Instability.** Many arcane abominations experience time differently than other creatures, sometimes seeing echoes of future events or reliving past moments. This temporal instability makes their behavior erratic and unpredictable, but also grants them uncanny combat awareness, as they may react to attacks before they occur.

> ##### Arcane Signatures
> *"Their magical signatures are unlike anything I've ever studied—chaotic, yes, but with patterns that suggest multiple spellcasting traditions somehow merged together. It's as if someone took a dozen different magical disciplines, forced them into a single vessel, and then shattered the boundaries between them. Fascinating and terrifying in equal measure."*

***Arcane Overflow.*** When casting a spell of 1st level or higher, the abomination can choose to cast it at one level higher than the spell slot used. If it does so, it takes 5 (1d10) force damage.

***Insane Mind.*** The abomination has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

***Magic Resistance.*** The abomination has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Unstable Form.*** The abomination can move through spaces as small as 1 foot wide without squeezing. Additionally, at the start of each of the abomination's turns, roll a d6. On a 1, it grows an additional limb until the start of its next turn, granting it one additional claw attack when it takes the Attack action.

***Multiattack.*** The abomination makes two claw attacks and one bite attack.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d6 + 5) slashing damage plus 7 (2d6) force damage.

***Bite.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 19 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) force damage.

***Reality Distortion (Recharge 5–6).*** The abomination warps reality in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Each creature in that area must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Additionally, on a failed save, a creature's position in space becomes unstable, and at the start of its next turn, it teleports to a random unoccupied space within 20 feet of its current position.

***Spellcasting.*** The abomination is a 12th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 16, +8 to hit with spell attacks). It has the following spells prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): *fire bolt, mage hand, minor illusion*
* 1st level (4 slots): *shield, magic missile*
* 2nd level (3 slots): *misty step, scorching ray*
* 3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, fireball, dispel magic*
* 4th level (3 slots): *dimension door, polymorph*
* 5th level (2 slots): *telekinesis, cloudkill*
* 6th level (1 slot): *chain lightning*

## Tactics
The ratling arcane abomination begins combat by casting powerful area-effect spells like Fireball or Cloudkill to soften up groups of enemies. It uses Reality Distortion when surrounded by multiple foes, then follows up with Chain Lightning against any that survive. The abomination relies on Misty Step and Dimension Door to maintain optimal positioning, keeping medium distance from enemies to utilize both spells and melee attacks effectively. If seriously threatened, it will use Arcane Overflow to cast spells at higher levels despite the damage to itself, viewing its own survival as secondary to inflicting maximum destruction on its enemies.

> *The abomination's form ripples and distorts as it channels arcane energy, crystalline growths pulsing with increasing intensity. Space itself seems to bend around it, colors inverting and shadows moving contrary to light sources. With a terrible screech that echoes before it's even uttered, the creature releases a wave of pure magical force that tears at the fabric of reality itself, leaving its victims disoriented and displaced in space and time.*
