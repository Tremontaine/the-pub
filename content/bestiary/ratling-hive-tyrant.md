# Ratling Hive Tyrant

*Gargantuan monstrosity, chaotic evil*

## Physical Description
The ratling hive tyrant is a monstrous behemoth that represents the apex of ratling evolution and magical enhancement. Standing over twenty feet tall, its massive frame combines ratlike features with insectoid and draconic elements—the result of countless magical experiments and selective breeding programs. Multiple arms of varying sizes and configurations extend from its torso, some ending in massive claws, others in more dexterous appendages capable of wielding weapons or casting spells. Its hide consists of overlapping plates of natural armor interspersed with patches of coarse fur, and pulsating veins of magical energy are visible beneath its skin. The tyrant's head retains recognizable ratling features, though grotesquely enlarged and adorned with multiple sets of horns and sensory appendages. When it moves, the ground trembles beneath its weight, and the air around it shimmers with barely contained magical energy that responds to its emotions and intent.

> *The chamber darkens as the colossal figure emerges from the shadows, its massive form blotting out light sources behind it. Plates of natural armor shift and settle with each movement, creating a sound like distant thunder. Multiple arms extend from its torso—some massive and ending in wicked claws, others more proportionate and carrying elaborate weapons or channeling arcane energies. Its head, though recognizably ratlike in its features, is adorned with multiple horns and sensory appendages that twitch and scan constantly. When it speaks, its voice carries the harmonics of multiple throats speaking in unison, creating an unsettling chorus that seems to bypass the ears and resonate directly within the mind.*

## Lore
**Apex Predators.** Hive tyrants represent the pinnacle of ratling biological and magical engineering—creatures specifically designed to command vast ratling warrens and lead them in times of war. Each tyrant is the product of generations of selective breeding combined with extensive magical augmentation, resulting in beings of tremendous physical power and considerable arcane capability.

**Living Legends.** The creation of a hive tyrant requires resources and magical knowledge beyond what most ratling warrens possess. Consequently, they are exceedingly rare, with perhaps only a dozen known to exist across the material plane. Each is unique in its specific capabilities and appearance, though all share the common traits of massive size, formidable combat prowess, and the ability to dominate lesser ratlings.

**Hive Controllers.** Hive tyrants possess an innate psychic connection to other ratlings, allowing them to directly control dozens of lesser specimens simultaneously. This control grows stronger with proximity and is particularly effective with ratlings that were bred within the tyrant's own warren. Some tyrants can extend this control over vast distances through specialized relay creatures, enabling them to coordinate activities across entire regions.

**Immortal Ambitions.** Unlike most ratlings, hive tyrants can live for centuries, growing larger and more powerful with age. Their extended lifespans allow them to develop complex, long-term strategies for expansion and conquest that may unfold over decades. The oldest tyrants are said to have witnessed the rise and fall of human empires, harboring grudges and ambitions that span generations.

> ##### The Breeding Program
> *"The creation of a hive tyrant begins before birth. Potential brood mothers are identified based on genetic markers and subjected to alchemical treatments throughout pregnancy. The resulting offspring undergo continuous enhancement from the moment of birth—specialized diets, magical infusions, surgical modifications, and countless other procedures. For every successful tyrant, hundreds of failed specimens are produced, many of which still serve as elite warriors despite falling short of the true tyrant potential."*

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the tyrant fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Magic Resistance.*** The tyrant has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Hive Mind Domination.*** The tyrant can use its action to dominate a ratling creature within 120 feet. The dominated ratling becomes completely loyal to the hive tyrant until it dies or the tyrant releases control. The tyrant can dominate up to six ratlings at once.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The tyrant's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 21). It can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

* At will: *detect magic, detect thoughts, mage hand*
* 3/day each: *counterspell, dispel magic, telekinesis*
* 1/day each: *gate, meteor swarm, power word stun*

***Regeneration.*** The tyrant regains 20 hit points at the start of its turn if it has at least 1 hit point.

***Siege Monster.*** The tyrant deals double damage to objects and structures.

***Multiattack.*** The tyrant makes four attacks: two with its claws, one with its bite, and one with its tail.

***Psychic Roar (Recharge 5–6).*** The tyrant emits a psychic roar in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 21 Wisdom saving throw, taking 42 (12d6) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. On a failed save, a creature is also stunned until the end of its next turn.

***Summon Ratlings (Recharge 5–6).*** The tyrant magically summons 2d6 ratling scouts, 1d4 ratling berserkers, or 1d2 ratling shamans. The summoned ratlings appear in unoccupied spaces within 60 feet of the tyrant and act on the tyrant's initiative. They remain for 1 hour, until they or the tyrant dies, or until the tyrant dismisses them as an action.

## Legendary Actions
The tyrant can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The tyrant regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Attack.*** The tyrant makes one claw attack.

***Move.*** The tyrant moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

***Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).*** The tyrant casts a spell from its list of innate spells.

***Psychic Scream (Costs 3 Actions).*** The tyrant emits a psychic scream. All creatures within 60 feet of it must make a DC 21 Intelligence saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) psychic damage and becoming stunned until the end of their next turn on a failed save, or half as much damage and not stunned on a successful one.

## Lair Actions
On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the tyrant takes a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the tyrant can't use the same effect two rounds in a row:

***Telekinetic Storm.*** Until the next initiative count 20, the floor of the lair is covered with debris and rubble, creating difficult terrain for all creatures other than the tyrant.

***Magical Overload.*** The lair pulses with arcane energy, requiring all creatures other than the tyrant to make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 18 (4d8) force damage.

***Command Warren.*** The tyrant psychically commands all ratlings in the lair. Each allied ratling can immediately make one weapon attack as a reaction.

## Tactics
The ratling hive tyrant begins combat by using Summon Ratlings to create a buffer of minions between itself and enemies, then positions itself where it can effectively use both ranged spells and its formidable melee attacks. It uses Psychic Roar to disable clusters of enemies, focusing particularly on spellcasters and other ranged threats. The tyrant employs Hive Mind Domination against powerful enemy creatures when possible, turning them against their allies. It uses its legendary actions strategically—attacking with claws when enemies are within reach, moving to maintain optimal positioning, and saving Psychic Scream for when multiple strong enemies are grouped together. The tyrant fights with surprising tactical intelligence, using its minions to test enemy capabilities before committing its full strength, and will retreat if necessary to preserve itself for future conquest.

> *The massive tyrant surveys the battlefield with calculating intelligence, its multiple arms moving in complex patterns as it simultaneously casts spells and directs its minions. The air distorts around it as it channels psychic energy, and lesser ratlings move with perfect coordination in response to its silent commands. Despite its enormous size, it moves with surprising grace and purpose, each action precisely calculated for maximum effect. When it finally speaks, the words carry both audibly and telepathically, resonating with an authority that makes even the most strong-willed creatures momentarily hesitate.*
