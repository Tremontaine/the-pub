# Ratling Shaman

*Small humanoid (ratfolk), chaotic evil*

## Physical Description
The ratling shaman stands slightly taller than most ratling scouts, its wiry frame draped in robes festooned with strange fetishes, small bones, and dried herbs that emit a pungent odor. Unlike other ratlings, its fur often displays unusual patterns or coloration—patches of white, black, or even unnatural hues that mark it as touched by strange powers. The shaman's eyes glow with an eerie luminescence, and wisps of strange energy occasionally dance between its splayed fingers. Its staff, typically made from a gnarled bone or twisted wood, is adorned with various trinkets and crystalline formations that pulse with arcane light. The shaman's movements are more deliberate than the twitchy motions of common ratlings, suggesting a mind focused on arcane formulas rather than survival instincts.

> *The ratling steps forward with uncharacteristic confidence, its glowing eyes fixed on some point beyond the visible realm. Whispered words spill from its mouth in a language that sounds like the chittering of vermin given terrible purpose. The air around it seems to warp and twist, while the shadows at its feet move contrary to the light, writhing like living things eager to do its bidding.*

## Lore
**Voices of the Deep Warrens.** Ratling shamans serve as intermediaries between their tribes and the strange entities they worship—often dark powers associated with disease, vermin, and the hidden places beneath the earth. They interpret omens, lead rituals, and ensure that proper sacrifices are made to keep these entities appeased. Their elevated status grants them significant influence within ratling society.

**Harbingers of Plague.** Many shamans specialize in manipulating diseases, seeing them as sacred gifts rather than afflictions. They cultivate various strains of pestilence, sometimes releasing them among enemy populations or using them to test the worthiness of their own kind. The strongest ratlings survive these "blessings," while the weak perish—a process the shamans view as natural selection.

**Keepers of Forbidden Knowledge.** Ratling shamans maintain oral traditions that span generations, preserving ancient secrets and magical formulae that predate many human civilizations. They are known to trade with other underground races, exchanging magical knowledge and artifacts. Some have even formed pacts with entities from the Far Realm, gaining power at the cost of their sanity.

**Marked by Madness.** The magic wielded by ratling shamans takes a toll on their minds. Many suffer from disturbing hallucinations or hear constant whispers from unseen sources. This madness is seen as a sign of divine favor among ratlings—the more deranged the shaman becomes, the more powerful they are perceived to be.

> ##### Twisted Magic
> *"Their magic feels wrong, like it's been twisted into something perverse. I've watched a ratling shaman heal one of its wounded—the wounds closed, yes, but the recipient's flesh bubbled and distorted in the process. Whatever powers they channel, they're not from any benevolent source I've ever encountered."*

***Mad Whisper (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** As a bonus action, the shaman can unleash a 30-foot radius pulse that causes all creatures (except Ratlings) within the area to make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Spellcasting.*** The shaman is a 7th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (save DC 14, +6 to hit with spell attacks). The shaman has the following spells prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): *chill touch, guidance, thaumaturgy*
* 1st level (4 slots): *magic missile, shield, thunderwave*
* 2nd level (3 slots): *misty step, scorching ray*
* 3rd level (3 slots): *counterspell, fireball*
* 4th level (1 slot): *banishment*

***Skittering Escape (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** When the shaman takes damage, it can use its reaction to turn partially incorporeal and move up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks. During this movement, it can pass through creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain, but takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.

***Staff.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 5 (1d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

***Rat Swarm.*** The shaman can summon a swarm of rats (as per the Monster Manual) to appear in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of it. The swarm acts on the ratling shaman's turn and follows its mental commands (no action required). The shaman can maintain control of up to three swarms at once.

***Pestilent Touch (Recharge 5–6).*** Melee Spell Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 21 (6d6) necrotic damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for 1 minute. While poisoned in this way, the target takes 7 (2d6) poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Tactics
The ratling shaman begins combat by summoning rat swarms to harass enemies and block escape routes. It uses Mad Whisper to frighten opponents, then targets the strongest-looking enemies with Pestilent Touch and powerful spells like Fireball. The shaman prioritizes keeping its distance from melee combatants, using Misty Step to escape when cornered and Skittering Escape as a last resort. If seriously threatened, it will sacrifice its followers to cover its retreat, viewing them as expendable resources in service to the greater ratling cause.

> *The shaman raises its staff, muttering words that sound like the scurrying of countless tiny feet. The very shadows around it seem to thicken and move with purpose, coalescing into chittering swarms of rats that pour forth in waves. All the while, the shaman's eyes never blink—focused on some terrible vision that only it can perceive, its mad whispers growing louder as the magical energies around it intensify.*
