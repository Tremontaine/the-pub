# Ratling Blood Warlord

*Medium humanoid (ratfolk), chaotic evil*

## Physical Description
The ratling blood warlord is a massive specimen of its kind, standing over seven feet tall with a powerfully built frame honed through countless battles. Its fur is a deep crimson—not its natural color, but stained permanently from ritual bathing in the blood of defeated enemies. Heavy plate armor crafted from exotic metals covers most of its body, adorned with spikes and decorated with runes etched in dried blood. The warlord's eyes glow with an unnatural red light, and its incisors have been replaced with metal fangs capable of tearing through armor. Deep ritual scarification covers what little skin is visible, forming patterns that pulse with dark energy when it enters combat. The warlord typically wields a massive greatsword inscribed with runes that flare with unholy fire when it strikes flesh.

> *The massive ratling's approach is heralded by the heavy tread of armored footfalls and the clink of bones and trophies adorning its battle plate. Blood-crusted fur visible at joints in its armor gives it a demonic appearance, enhanced by eyes that burn like coals in the darkness. As it draws its massive blade, the weapon thrums with hungry anticipation, runes flaring along its length as if awakening to the promise of slaughter. When the warlord speaks, its voice carries the hoarse quality of one who has shouted too many battle cries across too many blood-soaked fields.*

## Lore
**Blood Magic Practitioners.** Blood warlords represent a terrifying evolution of ratling warfare, combining martial prowess with blood magic rituals. Through the sacrifice of countless victims (willing and unwilling), they have infused their bodies with unholy strength and durability. These rituals often involve pacts with dark entities that grant power in exchange for continued bloodshed.

**Cult Leaders.** Most blood warlords command fanatical cult-like followings within ratling society. Their followers view them as living manifestations of ratling gods of war and willingly offer their blood—or that of captives—to strengthen their leader's connection to the dark powers they serve. The most powerful blood warlords may have hundreds or even thousands of devoted cultists.

**Living Weapons.** Through years of blood rituals, a blood warlord's body becomes saturated with magical energy. Their bones harden to near-metallic density, their muscles can tear through stone, and their blood itself becomes caustic to their enemies. Some ancient blood warlords are said to be virtually immortal, capable of regenerating from wounds that would kill any normal creature.

**Territorial Dominance.** Blood warlords are viciously territorial, establishing domains within the sprawling ratling underwarrens. Other ratling leaders give these territories wide berth, as blood warlords are known for their hair-trigger aggression and disproportionate retribution against any perceived infringement on their domain.

> ##### Blood Tithe
> *"The ritual of ascension takes years. First comes the Blood Tithe—one hundred enemies slain by the aspirant's hand, their hearts consumed raw. Then the Crimson Bath—immersion in the collected blood of one thousand victims while reciting the Dark Litany. Finally, the Communion of Essence—drinking the blood of a previous Blood Warlord, willing or not, to absorb their power. Many aspirants die during these trials. Those who survive emerge as something... more than ratling."*

***Frenzied Assault.*** When the warlord scores a critical hit with a melee weapon, it can make one additional melee weapon attack as a bonus action.

***Magic Resistance.*** The warlord has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Brutal Critical.*** The warlord rolls an additional weapon damage die when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a melee attack.

***Blood Magic.*** When the warlord hits a creature with a melee attack, it can choose to inflict a bleeding wound. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns due to blood loss. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, the bleeding can be stopped if a creature uses an action to make a DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check or if magical healing is applied to the wounded creature.

***Multiattack.*** The warlord makes three attacks with its greatsword.

***Greatsword.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +13 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d6 + 7) slashing damage plus 9 (2d8) necrotic damage.

***War Cry (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** Each ally within 30 feet of the warlord that can hear it gains advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of the warlord's next turn.

***Blood Sacrifice (Recharge 5–6).*** The warlord sacrifices some of its own blood to fuel a powerful attack. It takes 22 (4d10) necrotic damage and then makes a greatsword attack against each creature of its choice within 10 feet of it.

## Tactics
The ratling blood warlord begins combat with War Cry to empower its allies, then charges directly at the strongest-looking enemy, attempting to establish dominance through sheer brutality. It focuses its attacks on a single target until that target falls, triggering Frenzied Assault whenever possible for additional attacks. The warlord uses Blood Magic on particularly tough opponents to weaken them over time, and saves Blood Sacrifice for moments when it can hit multiple enemies at once. Unlike many powerful ratlings, the blood warlord rarely retreats, viewing death in battle as preferable to the shame of defeat.

> *The warlord raises its massive blade and lets loose a guttural cry that sends its followers into a frenzy of bloodlust. Its own eyes blaze brighter as it charges forward, moving with impossible speed despite its heavy armor. With each swing of its runed greatsword, blood sprays in unnatural patterns, momentarily forming symbols in the air before falling to feed the dark magic that pulses through the warlord's veins.*
