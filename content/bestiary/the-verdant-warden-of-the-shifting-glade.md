# The Verdant Warden of the Shifting Glade

*Large fey, chaotic neutral*

In the heart of the Feywild, where ancient trees whisper secrets to the wind and luminous flowers bloom in an eternal twilight, lies the Shifting Glade. It is a place of breathtaking beauty, a sanctuary where the veil between worlds is thin and the raw magic of the fey realm bleeds into the mortal world. But this idyllic haven is haunted by a tragic past, a cycle of endless conflict that has ensnared its guardian, the Verdant Warden, in an eternal, sorrowful loop.

The Warden, once a benevolent protector of the glade, is now a being of immense and unpredictable power, forever trapped in the echoes of a forgotten war. Its form, a mesmerizing tapestry of nature's elements, shifts with the seasons, each transformation heralding a new wave of conflict. Spring's vibrant growth gives way to the scorching fury of summer, the somber decay of autumn, and the chilling embrace of winter's end. Each phase is a reflection of the Warden's torment, its heart forever bound to a glade it can no longer save.

The tragedy began centuries ago when a forgotten evil sought to claim the Shifting Glade, to twist its magic to dark purposes. The Verdant Warden, in a desperate act of defiance, unleashed the full power of the seasons upon the invaders. But the victory was pyrrhic. The glade was scarred, its magic tainted, and the Warden itself was caught in the backwash of its own power, doomed to relive the final moments of the battle for all eternity.

Now, the Shifting Glade is a place of both wonder and sorrow. The air hums with a potent, untamed magic that draws the curious and the power-hungry alike. But those who enter find themselves caught in the Warden's endless cycle of conflict, forced to face the fury of the seasons as the guardian, driven by a fragmented memory of a long-lost war, lashes out at any who dare trespass upon its sacred ground. The Verdant Warden, once a symbol of life and renewal, has become a tragic figure, a prisoner of its own power, forever guarding a paradise lost in time. Its mournful cry echoes through the glade, a lament for a peace it can never reclaim, a testament to the enduring power of grief and the devastating consequences of a war that never truly ends.

*"A chilling wind sweeps through the glade as the Verdant Warden decays into the somber hues of autumn. Its once vibrant form withers into a tapestry of brittle, crimson leaves and gnarled, lifeless branches. Its eyes dim to a hollow amber glow, and the air grows heavy with the scent of decay.

## **Phase 4: Winter's End**
*"The glade falls deathly silent as the Verdant Warden succumbs to its final transformation. Its body, now a skeleton of frost-rimed branches and icy thorns, rises once more. Its eyes burn with a spectral blue light, and the air grows bitterly cold, freezing the very ground it stands upon. This is Winter's End, the realm of death, and the warden has become an avatar of eternal frost, a chilling reminder of the inevitable end that awaits all things."*

## Lair Actions

***Lair Actions.*** While in the Shifting Glade, the Verdant Warden can use lair actions. On initiative count 20 (losing initiative ties), the Warden can take a lair action to cause one of the following effects; the Warden can’t use the same effect two rounds in a row:

*   **Shifting Terrain (All Phases).**  The Warden magically alters the terrain in a 20-foot radius centered on a point it can see within 120 feet. The terrain becomes difficult terrain, lightly obscured, or both. This change lasts until the Warden uses this lair action again or until the Warden dies. Each phase also applies an additional effect:
    *   **Spring Growth:** The area is filled with healing energy. One creature of the Warden's choice in the area regains 10 (3d6) hit points.
    *   **Summer Fury:** The area erupts in flames. Each creature in the area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    *   **Autumn Wither:** The area becomes infused with withering energy. Each creature in the area must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, they take 10 (3d6) necrotic damage and cannot regain hit points until the start of initiative count 20 on the next round.
    *   **Winter's End:** The area is covered in a sheet of ice. Each creature in the area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.

*   **Nature's Call (All Phases).** The Warden calls upon the magic of the Feywild, creating one of the following effects. Each phase applies a unique effect:
    *   **Spring Growth:**  A **Swarm of Pixies** appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the Warden. The pixies are friendly to the Warden and obey its commands. The swarm acts on initiative count 20, after the Warden's lair action. The pixies disappear when the Warden enters a new phase.

    *   **Autumn Wither:**  Grasping roots erupt from the ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point the Warden can see within 60 feet. Each creature in the area must succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be restrained by the roots. A creature can use its action to make a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success.
    *   **Winter's End:** The Warden targets one creature it can see within 60 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw or be stunned until the start of initiative count 20 on the next round.
