# Flamekin

*Small elemental, neutral*

## Physical Description
A flamekin appears as a small, humanoid figure composed entirely of dancing flames. Standing about 3 feet tall, its body flickers between hues of orange, red, and occasional flashes of blue or white at its core. The creature's features are vaguely defined—bright spots suggest eyes, while its limbs trail wisps of smoke and embers as it moves. Though primarily flame, there's often a suggestion of a more solid, coal-like core beneath the fire. The air around a flamekin shimmers with heat, and small objects in its vicinity may singe or ignite if it remains stationary for too long.

> *A small figure composed entirely of living flame dances across the stone floor, leaving tiny scorch marks with each light step. Its movements are fluid and unpredictable, like the flames of a campfire animated with childlike curiosity. Where its fingertips trail, tiny embers float momentarily in the air before winking out of existence.*

## Lore
**Elemental Fragments.** Flamekins are believed to be fragments of larger fire elementals or perhaps the offspring of fire spirits that have found their way to the Material Plane. Unlike their larger elemental kin, flamekins often develop distinct personalities and can become curious about mortal life.

**Drawn to Warmth.** Flamekins are naturally attracted to sources of fire and heat. They frequently establish lairs near volcanic regions, desert heat vents, or areas with consistent magical fires. In populated areas, they might be found near forges, bakeries, or magical academies that practice fire magic.

**Mercurial Temperament.** Much like the flames they embody, flamekins' moods can shift rapidly. They can be playful and curious one moment, then destructively angry the next if they feel threatened or disrespected. Despite this volatility, they can form strong bonds with those who treat them with respect and provide them with interesting sources of fuel.

**Valued Assistants.** Some skilled artisans, particularly blacksmiths, glassblowers, and alchemists, form symbiotic relationships with flamekins. These craftspeople provide rare fuels and comfortable environments in exchange for the flamekins' help in maintaining perfect temperatures for delicate work.

> *"The little fire spirit that took up residence in my forge last winter has doubled my productivity. It keeps the temperature exactly where I need it without constant bellows work. Just don't forget the weekly tribute of coal sprinkled with copper filings—I still have the burn scars from the last time I forgot. Worth it, though."*

## Tactics
Flamekins prefer hit-and-run tactics, darting in to strike with their Flame Touch and then retreating to safety. They instinctively avoid water and creatures wielding cold-based attacks. When threatened, they seek to use their environment to their advantage, igniting flammable materials to create distractions or barriers. Multiple flamekins work together effectively, circling opponents to utilize their Fire Form ability from multiple directions. They are intelligent enough to recognize when they're outmatched and will flee rather than fight to the death, especially if a clear escape route exists.

> *The flamekin's form brightens with excitement as it darts between tables, leaving tiny trails of fire in its wake. It pauses occasionally to examine shiny objects with childlike curiosity, the flames of its body pulsing in rhythm like a heartbeat. When startled, it flares suddenly brighter, and the temperature in the room rises noticeably as it prepares either to flee or fight.*
