# Ratling Arcane Mechanist

*Medium humanoid (ratfolk), chaotic evil*

## Physical Description
The ratling arcane mechanist stands with unnatural stillness, its body a disturbing fusion of organic and mechanical components. Brass and copper tubes protrude from its flesh, pulsing with glowing arcane fluids that circulate through its modified body. One arm has been completely replaced with an articulated mechanical appendage ending in a variety of tools and weapons that can reconfigure themselves with whirring precision. Glass lenses and crystalline implants have replaced one or both of its eyes, giving it enhanced vision and the ability to perceive magical auras. The mechanist typically wears a heavy apron covered in scorch marks and alchemical stains, with dozens of pockets containing bizarre tools and components. Its fur has fallen out in patches where metal plates have been grafted directly to its skeleton, and the scent of ozone and machine oil surrounds it.

> *The ratling's movements are unnervingly precise, like a clockwork automaton rather than a living creature. Steam occasionally vents from tubes protruding from its spine, and its glass eyes whir and click as they focus on different elements in the environment. The mechanical arm extending from its right shoulder reconfigures itself constantly, tools and weapons folding into and out of compartments with seamless efficiency. When it speaks, its voice has an artificial resonance, as if filtered through brass pipes and crystal resonators.*

## Lore
**Fusion of Science and Sorcery.** Arcane mechanists represent a unique tradition among ratlings that combines technological innovation with magical principles. Unlike most ratling spellcasters who draw power from chaotic entities or raw elemental forces, mechanists approach magic as a science to be dissected, quantified, and integrated with mechanical systems.

**Creators of Constructs.** The mechanist's primary value to ratling society lies in its ability to create magical constructs and automata that serve as laborers, guards, and weapons. These creations range from simple mechanical vermin infused with minor enchantments to sophisticated battle constructs that combine clockwork precision with destructive magical capabilities.

**Self-Modification.** Mechanists view their own bodies as works in progress, constantly upgrading themselves with new implants and modifications. They see the fusion of flesh and machine as the ultimate path to perfection, believing that organic limitations can be overcome through careful application of arcane technology. The most experienced mechanists have replaced so much of their bodies that they are nearly constructs themselves.

**Hoarders of Technology.** Arcane mechanists are obsessive collectors of technological and magical artifacts, particularly those from ancient civilizations like the Netherese or Lantanese. They frequently send ratling scouts to infiltrate museums and arcane universities, stealing items that contain principles or components they haven't yet mastered.

> ##### Integration Process
> *"The early stages focus on simple reinforcement—metal plates bonded to bone, mechanical assistance for major muscle groups. As the subject adapts, we replace entire systems. The breakthrough comes with the circulatory integration, when we can replace blood with our alchemical fluid. That's when true arcane mechanization begins. The pain is... considerable, but those who survive emerge as something far beyond their original limitations."*

***Dual Mind.*** The mechanist has advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened.

***Magic Resistance.*** The mechanist has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Arcane Engineering.*** Constructs created by the mechanist gain a +2 to attack rolls and saving throws.

***Mechanized Body.*** The mechanist has resistance to critical hits. When a creature scores a critical hit against the mechanist, it deals normal damage instead of critical damage.

***Multiattack.*** The mechanist makes two arcane blast attacks.

***Arcane Blast.*** Ranged Spell Attack: +11 to hit, range 120 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (4d8 + 5) force damage.

***Mechanical Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15 (2d8 + 5) slashing damage plus 11 (2d10) lightning damage.

***Construct Overload (Recharge 5–6).*** The mechanist causes one of its constructs within 60 feet to overload, dealing 36 (8d8) lightning damage in a 20-foot radius around it. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Dexterity saving throw, taking half damage on a successful save. The construct is destroyed in the process.

***Repair Protocol (3/Day).*** The mechanist touches itself or a construct within 5 feet, restoring 55 (10d10) hit points to the target.

***Spellcasting.*** The mechanist is a 14th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks). The mechanist has the following spells prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): *mage hand, mending, prestidigitation, shocking grasp*
* 1st level (4 slots): *alarm, detect magic, shield, unseen servant*
* 2nd level (3 slots): *arcane lock, heat metal, see invisibility*
* 3rd level (3 slots): *animate objects, counterspell, lightning bolt*
* 4th level (3 slots): *fabricate, stone shape, summon construct*
* 5th level (2 slots): *animate objects, wall of force*
* 6th level (1 slot): *disintegrate, programmed illusion*
* 7th level (1 slot): *magnificent mansion*

***Summon Construct (1/Day).*** The mechanist magically calls forth a construct ally. This functions as the spell summon construct (as presented in Tasha's Cauldron of Everything), except that the construct summoned has a challenge rating of 5 or lower. The construct appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the mechanist and acts on the mechanist's initiative. The mechanist can maintain control of up to three such constructs at once.

## Tactics
The ratling arcane mechanist begins combat by summoning constructs to serve as buffers between itself and enemies, positioning them to control the battlefield. It uses Arcane Blast to target enemy spellcasters while directing its constructs to engage melee threats. The mechanist employs Repair Protocol to maintain its constructs when they take significant damage, and uses Construct Overload when facing clustered enemies or as a last resort if a construct is about to be destroyed anyway. The mechanist prioritizes its own survival above all else, viewing itself as a repository of irreplaceable knowledge, and will use Wall of Force to create barriers while it escapes if seriously threatened.

> *The mechanist's glass eyes whirl as it analyzes the battlefield, calculations and magical formulas scrolling across its vision. With precise gestures from its mechanical arm, it directs its constructs into optimal positions, each movement efficient and purposeful. Arcane energy builds around its modified body as it channels power through the network of tubes and crystals embedded in its flesh, releasing precision blasts of force that strike with mathematical accuracy.*
