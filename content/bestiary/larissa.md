# Larissa the Lamenter

*Medium undead, neutral evil*

## Physical Description
Larissa appears as a floating skull encased in a shimmering aura of arcane energy. All that remains of her once-human form is this spectral cranium, surrounded by wisps of necrotic energy that pulse with ancient power. Her eye sockets burn with an unnatural light that reflects centuries of bitterness and magical knowledge.

> "Her skull hovers in the darkness, surrounded by a nimbus of arcane light. Where eyes should be, only hatred glows."

## Lore
**Ancient Sorceress**  
Larissa was once a powerful sorceress who lived during the height of a great empire. She had everything she could ever desire – wealth, fame, and respect. However, she became obsessed with attaining immortality and delved deep into forbidden knowledge. Eventually, she succeeded in achieving eternal life, but at a terrible cost. Her body began to rot away, leaving behind nothing but a floating skull encased in a shimmering aura of arcane energy.

**Eternal Isolation**  
Despite being cursed with undeath, Larissa continued to study the arts of magic, becoming even more powerful over time. However, she soon realized that there was one thing she couldn't escape – loneliness. With most of her friends and allies long dead, Larissa felt isolated and alone. She eventually retreated to a secluded tower, where she spent centuries researching ways to reverse her curse.

**Descent into Hatred**  
Unfortunately, all her efforts proved fruitless, and Larissa grew increasingly bitter and resentful towards the world that had abandoned her. Now, driven by hatred and despair, Larissa seeks revenge against humanity, determined to destroy everything they hold dear.

***Rejuvenation.*** If she has a phylactery, Larissa regains all her hit points when reduced to 0 hit points.

***Undead Fortitude.*** If damage reduces Larissa to 0 hit points, she must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, she drops to 1 hit point instead.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, Larissa has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

***Negative Energy Channeling (Recharge 5-6).*** As an action, Larissa can emit a burst of negative energy in a 60-foot radius. Creatures of her choice within range regain hit points equal to twice the amount of necrotic damage dealt to living creatures. Living creatures take 42 (12d6) necrotic damage on a failed Constitution saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Paralyzing Gaze (Recharge 5-6).*** Larissa can stare into the soul of a creature within 30 feet, forcing it to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Create Spectral Servitor (1/day).*** Larissa can summon a spectral servant to do her bidding. The servitor has statistics similar to those of a shadow, but it can pass through solid objects as if they were difficult terrain. The servitor obeys Larissa's commands without question and remains in existence until it is destroyed or dismissed as a bonus action.

## Tactics
Larissa begins combat by using her Paralyzing Gaze on the most threatening opponent, then follows up with powerful spells like *finger of death* or *necrotic orb*. She uses her Create Spectral Servitor ability early to provide a distraction and additional threat. When surrounded, she employs Negative Energy Channeling to damage enemies while healing herself. If severely threatened, she uses *etherealness* or *teleport* to escape, returning later with a more calculated approach.

> "As the last of her foes fell, Larissa's hollow laughter echoed through the chamber—a sound that would haunt the survivors' nightmares for years to come."
