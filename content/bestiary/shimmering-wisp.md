# Shimmering Wisp

*Tiny elemental, unaligned*

## Physical Description
Shimmering Wisp appears as a small, luminous orb of energy that constantly shifts in color and intensity. Its form is never completely solid, seeming to pulse and flicker like a living flame without heat. Trails of ethereal light follow its movements, creating beautiful patterns in the air.

> Floating like a star fallen from the night sky, the wisp dances through the air with an otherworldly grace, its light casting strange shadows that seem to move of their own accord.

## Lore
**Origin of Wisps**
Shimmering Wisps are believed to be fragments of elemental energy that have gained a form of sentience. They are most commonly found in areas where the barriers between planes are thin, particularly near fey crossings or ancient magical sites.

**Behavior and Purpose**
Unlike many elementals, Shimmering Wisps rarely show aggression unless threatened. Many scholars believe they serve as messengers or scouts for more powerful elemental entities, collecting information about the Material Plane.

> ##### Wisp Sightings
> *The locals call them 'spirit lights' and say they guide lost travelers home... or lead them astray, depending on the wisp's mood.*

## Tactics
Shimmering Wisp typically avoids direct confrontation, using its flight and ethereal movement to stay out of reach. When forced to fight, it will dart in to make an incorporeal touch attack before retreating to safety. It uses its light to disorient enemies, often moving rapidly to create confusing patterns of illumination.

> As quickly as it appeared, the wisp fades into nothingness, leaving only the memory of its strange, beautiful light lingering in the darkness.
