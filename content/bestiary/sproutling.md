# Sproutling

*Small plant, neutral*

## Physical Description
A sproutling stands about 2 feet tall with a humanoid shape comprised entirely of vibrant green vegetation. Its body is slender and flexible, covered in small leaves and vines that constantly shift and sway even when the creature is still. The sproutling's face is a simple arrangement of small buds that serve as eyes and a slight indentation for a mouth. Short, whip-like tendrils extend from its arms, capable of lashing out with surprising speed and force. A faint, sweet scent reminiscent of fresh flowers follows the sproutling wherever it goes.

> *A small, childlike figure composed entirely of fresh green shoots and leaves darts between the trees, leaving a trail of tiny seedpods in its wake. Its movements are quick and erratic, like a sapling swaying in a strong breeze, and small spores occasionally puff from its body in glittering clouds.*

## Lore
**Forest Seedlings.** Sproutlings are believed to be the juvenile form of greater plant beings or perhaps the offspring of powerful forest spirits. They appear most commonly in ancient woodlands with strong connections to the Feywild or other realms of natural magic.

**Defenders of Growth.** Despite their diminutive size, sproutlings are tenacious defenders of forest ecosystems. They actively oppose those who harm plants or disrupt natural growth cycles. Druids and rangers often find sproutlings to be useful allies when tracking down those who have despoiled natural areas.

**Communal Beings.** Sproutlings rarely travel alone, preferring to move in small groups of 3-12 individuals. They communicate through a combination of rustling sounds, spore releases, and a limited form of telepathy that works only among their own kind. Elder forest creatures can sometimes understand these communications.

**Seasonal Cycles.** Sproutlings undergo transformative changes with the seasons. In spring, they are most active and vibrant; summer sees them at their strongest; autumn makes them more contemplative and inclined to spread seeds; and in winter, many sproutlings enter a dormant state beneath the soil until warmer weather returns.

> ##### Gardener's Note
> *"The trick to communicating with sproutlings is patience. Bring them fresh water, remove invasive plants from their territory, and in time, they may accept your presence. They're wonderful guardians for herb gardens but keep them away from freshly planted seeds—they sometimes can't resist replanting them according to their own mysterious designs."*

***Camouflage.*** The sproutling has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in terrain with vegetation.

***Plant Nourishment.*** The sproutling can gain sustenance from 4 hours of sunlight and fertile soil instead of food and water.

***Actions***

***Tendril Slash.*** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 5 (1d6 + 2) slashing damage.

***Sprout Burst (Recharge 5–6).*** The sproutling releases a burst of spores in a 10-ft. radius. Creatures in the area must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution save or be poisoned for 1 minute. A poisoned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

## Tactics
Sproutlings prefer to avoid direct confrontation, using their small size and camouflage to hide among vegetation. When threatened, they typically attack in groups, with some using their Tendril Slash while others position themselves to maximize the effectiveness of their Sprout Burst ability. They are intelligent enough to target those who appear to be actively damaging plants first. If outmatched, sproutlings scatter in different directions, using undergrowth and natural terrain to cover their retreat.

> *The sproutling freezes as you approach, its leafy body blending almost perfectly with the surrounding foliage. Only when you reach toward the rare flower beside it does it spring into action, tendrils lashing out as a cloud of glittering spores erupts from its body. The message is clear: the forest's treasures are under its protection.*
