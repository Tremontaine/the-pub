# Ratling Grand Vizier

*Medium humanoid (ratfolk), chaotic evil*

## Physical Description
The ratling grand vizier represents the pinnacle of ratling arcane achievement—a being whose physical form has been transformed and perfected through centuries of magical refinement. Standing tall and straight unlike most hunched ratlings, the grand vizier's body appears almost regal in its bearing. Its fur has a metallic sheen that shifts colors subtly with its movements and emotional states, while its eyes glow with inner arcane fire that changes color depending on the school of magic it is channeling. The vizier wears elaborate robes covered in constantly shifting runes that occasionally detach themselves and orbit its body before reattaching in new configurations. Its hands have elongated fingers tipped with crystalline claws that serve as natural focuses for its spellcasting. The air around the vizier is noticeably charged with magical energy, causing minor arcane phenomena in its vicinity—small objects levitate, candles flicker in patterns corresponding to its thoughts, and occasionally reality itself seems to ripple like water when it channels significant power.

> *The ratling's entrance is heralded by a wave of arcane pressure that causes the very air to shimmer. It moves with regal grace, each step deliberate and precise as the elaborate runes adorning its robes shift and reconfigure themselves in endless patterns of magical formulae. Its fur gleams with metallic iridescence, reflecting light in ways that seem to defy natural laws, while its eyes burn with inner power that shifts between colors as it surveys its surroundings. When it speaks, its voice carries layers of harmonic resonance that cause the air itself to vibrate in sympathy, and the crystalline claws at the ends of its elongated fingers trace glowing sigils that linger momentarily before dissolving back into the ambient magic that surrounds it.*

## Lore
**Arcane Perfectionist.** Grand viziers represent the ultimate expression of ratling arcane tradition—spellcasters who have dedicated centuries to the perfection of magical theory and practice. Unlike the chaotic experimentation common to most ratling magic users, viziers approach magic with methodical precision, testing and refining their techniques over decades to achieve perfect control and efficiency.

**Ageless Masters.** Like elder sages, grand viziers have extended their natural lifespans through magical means, often living for many centuries. This extended existence allows them to master multiple schools of magic and develop entirely new arcane theories and techniques. Many viziers have personally witnessed the rise and fall of human empires, collecting magical knowledge from each civilization before its inevitable decline.

**Political Kingmakers.** While viziers rarely rule ratling society directly, they often serve as the true power behind multiple thrones. A single grand vizier might simultaneously advise and manipulate several ratling kings, queens, or warlords, using them as instruments to implement different aspects of their grand designs. The most powerful viziers maintain networks of agents throughout the known world, collecting information and magical artifacts.

**Magical Innovators.** Grand viziers are responsible for most of the unique magical traditions that have emerged from ratling society. Their innovations typically emphasize efficiency, adaptability, and unpredictability—allowing ratling spellcasters to overcome the magical traditions of more established races through surprise and versatility rather than raw power.

> ##### The Grand Experiment
> *"The current Grand Vizier of the Eastern Warrens is rumored to be conducting what he calls 'The Grand Experiment'—an attempt to create a new form of magic that combines elements of traditional arcane casting with the reality-warping properties of aberrant psionics. Initial reports suggest he has achieved some success, developing spells that can adapt themselves to counteract specific defenses or modify their effects based on the target's own magical nature. If these reports are accurate, we may be witnessing the birth of an entirely new magical tradition—one that could threaten the established arcane order."*

***Master of Spellcasting.*** The Grand Vizier can cast any wizard spell of 8th level or lower without needing material components.

***Magic Resistance.*** The Grand Vizier has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Arcane Tempest.*** When the Grand Vizier is targeted by a spell, it can use its reaction to release a burst of arcane energy, forcing all creatures within 30 feet to make a DC 27 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 44 (8d10) force damage, or half as much on a successful save.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the Grand Vizier fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Spell Adaptation.*** Whenever the Grand Vizier casts a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw, it can choose one creature that must make that saving throw. That creature has disadvantage on the saving throw.

***Arcane Rejuvenation.*** When the Grand Vizier finishes a short rest, it can choose to recover spell slots that have a combined level equal to or less than half its wizard level (rounded up).

***Multiattack.*** The Grand Vizier makes two Arcane Scepter attacks or casts two spells.

***Arcane Scepter.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +19 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 32 (4d10 + 10) force damage.

***Arcane Eruption (Recharge 5-6).*** The Grand Vizier causes a 20-foot radius explosion within 120 feet. Each creature in that area must make a DC 27 Dexterity saving throw, taking 65 (10d12) force damage and being knocked prone on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Spellcasting.*** The Grand Vizier is a 26th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 27, +19 to hit with spell attacks). The Grand Vizier has the following spells prepared:

* Cantrips (at will): *fire bolt, mage hand, prestidigitation, ray of frost, shocking grasp, dancing lights, minor illusion*
* 1st level (4 slots): *shield, magic missile, detect magic, identify, mage armor*

* 9th level (3 slots): *meteor swarm, time stop, wish, power word kill*

***Alternating Contingency (Recharge 5-6).*** The Grand Vizier can store multiple contingent spells that trigger under specific circumstances. It typically has the following contingencies prepared:
- If reduced below 100 hit points, automatically cast *time stop*
- If targeted by a spell of 7th level or higher, automatically cast *counterspell*
- If restrained or incapacitated, automatically cast *dimension door*

## Legendary Actions
The Grand Vizier can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The Grand Vizier regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Scepter Attack.*** The Grand Vizier makes one Arcane Scepter attack.

***Arcane Shield.*** Until the end of the Grand Vizier's next turn, it gains a +2 bonus to AC and saving throws.

***Cast a Spell (Costs 2 Actions).*** The Grand Vizier casts a spell of 3rd level or lower from its list of prepared spells that takes 1 action to cast.

***Reality Warp (Costs 3 Actions).*** The Grand Vizier warps reality in a 30-foot radius around itself. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 27 Constitution saving throw or take 42 (12d6) force damage and have its speed reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. Additionally, the area becomes difficult terrain until the end of the Grand Vizier's next turn.

## Tactics
The ratling grand vizier begins combat by assessing threats, typically using Time Stop to set up powerful combinations of spells or to position itself optimally. It casts Globe of Invulnerability early to protect against enemy spellcasters and uses Counterspell liberally to prevent dangerous magic from affecting it. Against multiple enemies, it employs area damage spells like Meteor Swarm and Chain Lightning, using its Spell Adaptation ability to ensure key targets fail their saving throws. The vizier uses its Arcane Scepter against enemies that display effective magical defenses, and keeps Dimension Door and Teleport prepared for strategic repositioning. If seriously threatened, it will use Wish to duplicate powerful defensive spells or create effects specifically tailored to counter the current threat.

> *The Grand Vizier analyzes the battlefield with calculating precision, its eyes shifting between colors as it rapidly cycles through potential spell combinations. With subtle gestures of its crystalline claws, it weaves multiple spells simultaneously, the runes on its robes detaching and orbiting its body as they contribute to the complex magical formulations. Reality itself seems to bend to its will, time and space becoming malleable tools in its arsenal rather than fixed constants. When it finally strikes, the attack comes not as a singular spell but as a precisely orchestrated symphony of arcane effects, each element amplifying and complementing the others in ways that no lesser spellcaster could conceive.*
