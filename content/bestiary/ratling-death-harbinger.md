# Ratling Death Harbinger

*Large monstrosity, chaotic evil*

## Physical Description
The ratling death harbinger is a massive, nightmarish fusion of ratling and necrotic energy that towers over its lesser kin. Standing at least ten feet tall, its skeletal frame has been warped and expanded, with bones visible through patches of decaying flesh and tattered fur. Its eyes burn with unholy green fire that leaves trails of spectral energy when it moves, and a miasma of decay surrounds it at all times. The death harbinger's claws have elongated into scythe-like appendages of bone infused with necrotic energy, and its tail has transformed into a barbed, whip-like weapon capable of striking with tremendous force. Its mouth, when opened, reveals row upon row of serrated teeth that seem to absorb rather than reflect light. Multiple smaller skulls—trophies from significant kills—are fused to its shoulders and spine, occasionally chattering or whispering when the harbinger channels its power.

> *The massive creature's approach silences all natural sounds, as if life itself recoils from its presence. Each step leaves a momentary imprint of withered vegetation, and the air temperature plummets in its vicinity. The skeletal ratling moves with unnatural grace despite its size, bones creaking and shifting as if held together by will rather than sinew. The green flames that serve as its eyes survey the area with ancient malevolence, and when it speaks, multiple voices emerge simultaneously—some pleading, others threatening, all tinged with the hollow echo of the grave.*

## Lore
**Death Incarnate.** Death harbingers represent the ultimate expression of ratling necromancy—creatures that have transcended the boundary between life and death through forbidden rituals. They begin as especially powerful ratling necromancers who, upon reaching the end of their natural lifespan, undergo a transformation ritual that binds their soul to their partially undead body, creating an entity that exists in both realms simultaneously.

**Soul Collectors.** Each death harbinger is driven by an insatiable hunger for souls, which it harvests through combat and ritual sacrifice. These souls serve multiple purposes—powering the harbinger's abilities, maintaining its unnatural existence, and serving as currency in transactions with entities from the darker planes of existence. The most powerful harbingers maintain collections of thousands of souls, each preserved in crystalline containers for specific uses.

**Living Relics.** Unlike most ratlings, death harbingers can exist for centuries or even millennia, making them living repositories of ancient knowledge and forgotten magic. They often remember civilizations long turned to dust and magical traditions lost to time. This perspective makes them simultaneously valuable advisors and dangerous wild cards in ratling politics, as their agendas may span timeframes incomprehensible to their shorter-lived kin.

**Fear Incarnate.** The mere presence of a death harbinger inspires supernatural terror in living creatures. This fear is not merely psychological but metaphysical—a natural response of life force in the presence of its antithesis. Harbingers cultivate this aura of dread, surrounding themselves with macabre decorations and speaking in ways designed to maximize psychological distress in those who hear them.

> ##### The Final Transformation
> *"The Binding of Essence requires thirteen master necromancers channeling in perfect synchronization while the aspirant consumes thirteen vials of distilled soul essence. As the ritual progresses, death claims the aspirant—but only briefly. The soul remains tethered to the body, which begins to transform, incorporating elements of both life and death into a new form. Few survive this process with their sanity intact, but those who do gain power that blurs the line between necromancer and necromancy itself."*

***Aura of Fear.*** Any creature that starts its turn within 20 feet of the death harbinger must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw, or be frightened for 1 minute. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to this effect for 24 hours.

***Magic Resistance.*** The harbinger has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Unholy Fortitude.*** When the harbinger takes damage that would reduce it to 0 hit points, it instead drops to 1 hit point unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. This trait can't be used again until the harbinger finishes a long rest.

***Soul Drain.*** When a creature dies within 60 feet of the harbinger, the harbinger regains 15 hit points.

***Multiattack.*** The harbinger makes four melee attacks: two with its claws and two with its tail.

***Claw.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 21 (3d8 + 7) slashing damage plus 14 (4d6) necrotic damage.

***Tail.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +14 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. Hit: 25 (4d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage plus 10 (3d6) necrotic damage.

***Necrotic Wave (Recharge 5–6).*** The harbinger releases a wave of necrotic energy in a 60-foot radius. Each creature in that area must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 54 (12d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures that fail the save by 5 or more have their hit point maximum reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest.

***Death Whisper (Recharge 5–6).*** The harbinger whispers words of power. Each creature of the harbinger's choice within 30 feet that can hear it must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 minute. A paralyzed creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

***Animate Dead (3/Day).*** The harbinger targets up to three corpses of Medium or Small humanoids within 60 feet. Each corpse becomes a zombie under the harbinger's control. The zombies act immediately after the harbinger in the initiative order and obey its mental commands.

## Legendary Actions
The harbinger can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time and only at the end of another creature's turn. The harbinger regains spent legendary actions at the start of its turn.

***Attack.*** The harbinger makes one claw attack.

***Move.*** The harbinger moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

***Horrify (Costs 2 Actions).*** The harbinger targets one creature it can see within 30 feet. The target must succeed on a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw or be paralyzed until the end of the harbinger's next turn.

***Soul Rend (Costs 3 Actions).*** The harbinger targets one creature it can see within 30 feet. The target must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw, taking 36 (8d8) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The harbinger regains hit points equal to half the damage dealt.

## Tactics
The ratling death harbinger begins combat by using its Aura of Fear to demoralize opponents, then follows with Death Whisper to paralyze as many enemies as possible. It prioritizes eliminating spellcasters capable of healing or dealing radiant damage, recognizing them as particularly threatening to its necrotic nature. The harbinger uses Necrotic Wave when multiple enemies are clustered together, and employs its legendary actions strategically—using Horrify to disable dangerous opponents and Soul Rend to both damage enemies and heal itself. It uses Animate Dead opportunistically to create distractions and additional threats, particularly creating zombies from fallen enemies to demoralize their companions. The harbinger fights with the patience of an immortal being, willing to employ hit-and-run tactics over extended periods if necessary to wear down powerful opposition.

> *The death harbinger moves with the certainty of something that has witnessed countless battles over centuries of existence. Green fire trails from its eye sockets as it surveys the battlefield, identifying the greatest threats with ancient wisdom. With a gesture of its bone-blade arms, it commands the dead to rise while simultaneously releasing waves of necrotic energy that wither everything they touch. Its movements combine the feral quickness of a ratling with the implacable purpose of death itself—methodical yet explosive when necessary.*
