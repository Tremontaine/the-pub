# Bonewrought Husk

*Medium undead, neutral evil*

## Physical Description
The Bonewrought Husk is a grotesque amalgamation of bone and sinew, with patches of leathery skin stretched tight over its frame. Its joints are unnaturally flexible, allowing for disturbing contortions. A faint green glow emanates from within its ribcage, pulsing like a mockery of a heartbeat. Its hands are disproportionately large, with elongated fingers ending in sharpened bone.

> Its movements are jerky yet purposeful, like a puppet controlled by invisible strings. When it opens its jaw, no sound emerges except a hollow, rattling breath.

***Undead Nature.*** The Bonewrought Husk doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

***Regeneration.*** The Bonewrought Husk regains 5 hit points at the start of its turn. If the Bonewrought Husk takes radiant damage, this trait doesn't function at the start of the Bonewrought Husk's next turn.

**Multiattack.** The Bonewrought Husk makes two attacks with its Grasping Hands.

**Grasping Hands.** *Melee Weapon Attack:* +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. *Hit:* 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or be grappled by the Husk. While grappled in this way, the target is restrained, and the Husk can't use its hands on another target.

**Spectral Howl (Recharge 5-6).** The Bonewrought Husk releases a chilling spectral howl. Each creature within 30 feet of the husk that can hear it must make a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to the husk's Spectral Howl for the next 24 hours.

## Tactics
The Bonewrought Husk serves as the Bonewhisper Sovereign's enforcer, using its grappling abilities to immobilize threats. It typically opens combat with its Spectral Howl to frighten opponents before closing in to grapple the most dangerous-looking enemy. Once it has a target restrained, it will maintain the grapple while other undead minions attack the helpless victim.
