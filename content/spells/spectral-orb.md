# Spectral Orb

*Evocation cantrip*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You conjure a pulsating orb of ethereal energy that glows with an otherworldly blue luminescence. The orb hovers momentarily before your outstretched hand, its surface rippling with spectral faces that silently scream.

Make a ranged spell attack against a creature within range. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 force damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you and become marked with spectral energy until the end of your next turn.

A marked creature sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius and has disadvantage on attack rolls against you. Additionally, the next time you cast this spell before the mark ends, you can target the marked creature even if they have total cover or are invisible to you, as the spectral energy guides your magic unerringly to them.

The spell's damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).
