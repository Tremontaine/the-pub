# Phantasmal Terrain

*3rd-level illusion*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 300 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a stone, twig, and bit of green plant wrapped in a strip of silk)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You weave an intricate illusion over a 40-foot cube of natural terrain, altering its appearance to mimic any other type of natural terrain. The illusion affects all senses, creating appropriate sounds, smells, temperatures, and even tactile sensations, though physical interaction reveals the true nature of the terrain to the individual touching it.

Any creature that enters the area or starts its turn within the illusion must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is completely convinced by the illusion and interacts with it as though it were real, potentially suffering consequences based on their actions:

- A creature that believes it's walking on solid ground when it's actually water might begin drowning.
- A creature that thinks it's walking on flat terrain when it's actually a cliff might fall.
- A creature that believes it's walking through fire might drop to the ground and roll to extinguish imaginary flames.

Creatures that fail their saving throw take 3d6 psychic damage the first time each turn they interact with the terrain in a way that would be harmful if the illusion were real. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw can see through the illusion and suffers no ill effects from interacting with it.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the psychic damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
