# Weirdshield

*7th-level abjuration*
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you are targeted by a spell
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a rippling barrier of magical energy that attempts to absorb or deflect incoming spells. When a spell targets only you, make an Intelligence saving throw against the caster's spell save DC. On a success, the spell has no effect on you and is reflected back at the caster, who becomes the target of the spell instead.

If the reflected spell requires concentration, the original caster must concentrate on it or the spell ends. You are immune to the reflected spell's effects.
