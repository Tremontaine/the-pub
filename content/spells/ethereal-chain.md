# Ethereal Chain

*4th-level conjuration*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a tiny chain)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a magical chain made of pure energy that lashes out at your enemies. Choose one creature you can see within range. The chain strikes the target automatically. The target then makes a Strength saving throw.

On a failed save, the target is restrained. The chain then magically anchors itself to the ground and cannot move along with the target. The target can use its action to attempt to break free, repeating the Strength saving throw. Once the target breaks free or the spell ends, the chain vanishes.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the number of chains you can create simultaneously increases by one for each slot level above 4th.
