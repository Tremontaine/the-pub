# Desert's Embrace

*8th-level transmutation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a vial of water from a desert oasis)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You create a 60-foot-radius sphere of desiccating energy centered on a point you can see within range. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration, and any water in the area immediately evaporates.

When a creature starts its turn in the affected area or enters it for the first time on its turn, it must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 8d6 necrotic damage and gains one level of exhaustion as moisture is drawn from its body. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and doesn't gain exhaustion.

Plants and water elementals have disadvantage on this saving throw. Plant creatures take double damage from the spell.

Additionally, all non-magical plants in the area wither and die, and water-based magical effects have a 75% chance of failing when used in the area.
