# Spirit Guardians of the Elders

*7th-level conjuration*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15-foot radius)
- **Components:** V, S, M (a holy symbol and a relic from an ancient warrior)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You summon the spirits of legendary warriors from ages past, calling them to your aid in battle. Spectral figures materialize around you in a 15-foot radius, each bearing the arms and armor of their era. Their forms shift between solid and translucent as they patrol the area, their eyes burning with otherworldly light.

When you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be unaffected by it. For the duration, the area is considered difficult terrain for your enemies, and when a hostile creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw.

On a failed save, the creature takes 4d8 radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 4d8 necrotic damage (if you are evil), and one of the spirit guardians attaches to it. A creature with an attached guardian has disadvantage on attack rolls against you and your allies, and whenever it takes damage, the guardian deals an additional 2d8 damage of the same type as the initial spell damage.

On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and no guardian attaches to it.

A creature with an attached guardian can use its action to make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, it breaks free of the guardian, which returns to the main area of the spell.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can command one of the spirit guardians to make a melee spell attack against a creature within the spell's radius. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 force damage and must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 10 feet away from you and knocked prone.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 7th.
