# Arcane Severance

*8th-level abjuration*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a silver dagger worth at least 500 gp)
- **Duration:** 24 hours

You sever a creature's connection to the Weave of magic. Choose a creature you can see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target cannot cast spells or use any magical abilities for the duration. Additionally, the target cannot benefit from magical effects, including those from potions, scrolls, or magic items.

The spell can also be used to target a 20-foot cube within range. Any magical effects in that area are suppressed for the duration, and any creature that starts its turn in the area or enters it for the first time on its turn must make an Intelligence saving throw or be affected as described above.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, the duration becomes "until dispelled."
