# Animate Dead Swarm

*7th-level necromancy*
- **Casting Time:** 1 minute
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a handful of grave dirt)
- **Duration:** Until dispelled

You touch up to ten corpses within range, causing them to rise as skeletons or zombies under your control. These undead obey your commands without question and remain in existence until they are destroyed or you dismiss them as a bonus action.

While animated, these undead gain the following benefits:
* Their speed increases by 10 feet.
* They gain resistance to nonmagical weapon damage.
* They gain proficiency in one skill of your choice.

Additionally, while any of the undead remains within 60 feet of you, you can use a bonus action to mentally command any number of them to perform a simple task that doesn't require thought, such as "Attack that creature," "Move here," or "Open that door." You can also use a bonus action to dismiss the undead if they are within 60 feet of you.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or higher, the number of corpses you can affect increases by five for each slot level above 7th.
