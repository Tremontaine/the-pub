# Necrotic Orb

*3rd-level necromancy*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 120 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You hurl an orb of negative energy at a point you can see within range. Each creature within a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.
