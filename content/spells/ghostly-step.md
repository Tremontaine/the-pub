# Ghostly Step

*6th-level transmutation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 bonus action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

With a whispered incantation, your form becomes translucent and ethereal, shifting partially into the Ethereal Plane. Your body takes on a ghostly blue luminescence, and wisps of spectral energy trail behind you as you move.

For the duration, you gain the following benefits:
- You can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 5 (1d10) force damage if you end your turn inside an object.
- You have resistance to all damage except force damage.
- You can see into both the Material Plane and the Ethereal Plane simultaneously, perceiving ethereal creatures and objects within 60 feet of you.
- Once per turn, you can choose to fully shift into the Ethereal Plane or back to the Material Plane as part of your movement.

While fully in the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by creatures on that plane. Creatures on the Material Plane can't perceive you and can't interact with you, unless they have the ability to see into the Ethereal Plane.

As an action while under the effects of this spell, you can attempt to possess a humanoid creature you can see within 5 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be possessed by you for up to 1 minute or until you end this effect as a bonus action. Your body becomes completely incorporeal during the possession. While possessing a creature, you control its actions but don't gain access to its knowledge, class features, or proficiencies. The target is aware of the possession and can fight against you by using its action to make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the possession ends.
