# Ectoplasmic Web

*3rd-level conjuration*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb soaked in ectoplasm from the Ethereal Plane)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

With a haunting whisper, you tear open a small rift to the Ethereal Plane, from which pours a mass of translucent, sticky strands that shimmer with spectral light. The ethereal webs blanket a 20-foot cube within range, filling it with ghostly whispers that only those trapped within can hear.

The area becomes difficult terrain. Any creature that starts its turn in the area or enters it during its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is restrained and suffers disadvantage on saving throws against your spells until the end of its next turn.

A creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself but takes 2d4 psychic damage as the spectral strands tear at its mind while breaking.

**At Higher Levels.** When cast using a spell slot of 4nd level or higher, the psychic damage increases by 1d4 for each slot level above 1st, and creatures that fail their initial saving throw are also frightened until they escape the web.
