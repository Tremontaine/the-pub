# Haunting Echoes

*4th-level evocation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 150 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You emit a bone-chilling, spectral sound that reverberates through the area, carrying with it fragments of forgotten memories and lost souls. The sound manifests as a 20-foot radius sphere centered on a point you can see within range, filling the area with swirling, translucent apparitions.

Each creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 4d8 psychic damage and becomes deafened and frightened for the duration. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no additional effects.

While the spell persists, the haunting echoes remain in the area. Any creature that enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make the Wisdom saving throw.

A frightened creature hears personalized whispers of its deepest fears and regrets. At the start of each of its turns, it must use its action to make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, it takes 2d8 psychic damage and must use its movement to flee from the center of the spell's effect. On a success, the effects of the spell on the creature ends.
