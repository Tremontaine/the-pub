# Frost Lance

A spear of ice shoots from your hand toward a creature you can see within range.

Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 3d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.

## Casting Notes

The ice crystal used in casting shatters upon completing the spell. The spell also leaves a thin trail of frost in the air between you and the target, which dissipates after a few seconds.
