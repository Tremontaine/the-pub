# Crushing Sphere

*5th-level evocation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create a 10-foot-diameter sphere of compressed force at a point you can see within range. Any creature that starts its turn within the sphere or enters it for the first time on a turn must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 force damage and is restrained for the duration. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and isn't restrained.

A restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength check against the your spell save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained but still takes 3d10 force damage.

As a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet in any direction. If the sphere moves over a creature, that creature must make the saving throw as if it had entered the sphere.
