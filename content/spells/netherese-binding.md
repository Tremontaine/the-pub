# Netherese Binding

*5th-level abjuration*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small silver chain worth at least 100 gp)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You create shimmering bands of blue energy that wrap around a creature you can see within range. The target must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target's speed becomes 0, it can't benefit from any bonus to its speed, and it has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.

Additionally, the target cannot teleport or use any form of magical transportation. If the target attempts to cast a spell, it must first succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or the spell fails and the spell slot is wasted.

At the end of each of its turns, the target can make a Strength saving throw. On a success, the spell ends on the target.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the duration increases to 10 minutes. At 7th level, the duration increases to 1 hour. At 9th level, the spell does not need concentration and lasts until dispelled.
