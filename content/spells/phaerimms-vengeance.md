# Phaerimm's Vengeance

*9th-level necromancy*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 1 mile
- **Components:** V, S, M (a gemstone worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You unleash the devastating magic that once turned verdant lands into desert. Choose a point you can see within range. A 300-foot-radius sphere centered on that point is affected by catastrophic life-draining energy.

All plants in the area immediately wither and die. The ground becomes cracked and arid. Any body of water in the area is reduced to half its volume, and natural sources of water (such as springs) dry up completely.

Each creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d10 necrotic damage and gains three levels of exhaustion as the moisture is drawn from its body. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and gains one level of exhaustion.

For the duration, the area is considered difficult terrain. Any creature that starts its turn in the area or enters it for the first time on its turn must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 6d10 necrotic damage and gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage and doesn't gain exhaustion.

Additionally, for 1 year after casting this spell, the affected area remains a barren wasteland. Plants refuse to grow there, water evaporates at twice the normal rate, and creatures that spend more than 8 hours in the area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.
