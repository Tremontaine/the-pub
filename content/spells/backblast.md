# Backblast

*8th-level evocation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (60-foot cone)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You release a devastating cone of desiccating energy from your mouth. Each creature in a 60-foot cone must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d8 necrotic damage and 6d8 force damage, and its hit point maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. This reduction lasts until the creature finishes a long rest. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and its hit point maximum is not reduced.

Plants and water elementals have disadvantage on this saving throw and take double necrotic damage.
