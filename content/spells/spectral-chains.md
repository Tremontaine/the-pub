# Spectral Chains

*2nd-level evocation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You thrust your hands forward as ghostly, rune-inscribed chains materialize from your fingertips, each link forged from the essence of departed souls. The chains lash out toward a creature you can see within range, emitting a mournful wail as they fly through the air.

The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the spectral chains. While restrained, the target takes 2d6 necrotic damage at the start of each of its turns as the chains drain its life force, and you gain temporary hit points equal to half the damage dealt.

The restrained creature can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it breaks free of the chains, which then target another creature of your choice within 30 feet of the original target. The new target must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become restrained by the chains. If no new target is available, the chains dissipate into wisps of spectral energy.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd, and you can initially target one additional creature for every two slot levels above 2nd.
