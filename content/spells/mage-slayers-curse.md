# Mage-Slayer's Curse

*3rd-level enchantment*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a torn page from a spellbook)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You place a debilitating curse on a spellcaster within range. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be cursed for the duration. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks using its spellcasting ability, and whenever it casts a spell, it must roll a d20. On a roll of 5 or lower, the spell fails and the spell slot is wasted.

Additionally, whenever the cursed creature casts a spell, it takes 1d8 psychic damage per level of the spell cast.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the duration increases to 10 minutes. At 5th level or higher, the duration increases to 1 hour. At 7th level or higher, the spell doesn't require concentration.
