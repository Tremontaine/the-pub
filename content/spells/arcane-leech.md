# Arcane Leech

*1st-level necromancy*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You attempt to drain magical energy from a spellcaster. Choose one creature within range that can cast spells. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the target loses one spell slot of the lowest level available (your choice if there are multiple slots of the same level). If the target has no spell slots remaining, it takes 2d6 necrotic damage instead.

You gain temporary hit points equal to twice the level of the spell slot drained (minimum of 2). These temporary hit points last for 1 hour.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you can drain a spell slot of a level equal to or less than the spell slot you used minus one.
