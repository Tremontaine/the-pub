# Desert's Touch

*6nd-level transmutation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of sand)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

You infuse your hands with the desiccating power of the desert. Make a melee spell attack against a creature or object. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 necrotic damage, and if it's a creature, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion as moisture is drawn from its body.

If you touch a plant creature or a magical plant, it takes double damage, and if you touch a non-magical plant that isn't a creature, it automatically withers and dies.

If you touch a water elemental, it takes 6d8 necrotic damage and has disadvantage on attack rolls until the end of your next turn.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
