# Arcane Consumption

*4th-level abjuration*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You create a vacuum of magical energy that consumes active spells in the area. Choose a point within range. All spells of 3rd level or lower in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point end immediately. For each spell thus ended, you regain 5 hit points.

For each spell of 4th level or higher in the area, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell's level. On a success, the spell ends, and you regain 5 hit points per level of the spell.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you automatically end spells of a level equal to or less than the spell slot level minus 1 without needing to make an ability check.
