# Spell Fangs

*Evocation cantrip*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** None
- **Duration:** 1 minute

You teeth glow with arcane energy as they teeth become charged with magical force. For the duration, your bite attacks deal an additional 2d8 force damage and count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

If you hits a creature with your bite attack while this spell is active, you can choose to discharge the magical energy. The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 4d8 force damage, and the spell ends.
