# Arcane Devastation

*9th-level evocation*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (120-foot radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You unleash a devastating wave of pure arcane energy. Each creature other within 120 feet must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d12 force damage and has its connection to magic severed for 1 minute. During this time, the creature cannot cast spells or use any magical abilities, and any magic items it carries cease to function for the duration. Creatures that succeed on their saving throw take half damage and aren't cut off from magic. Magic items they carry are unaffected. You automatically succeed on this saving throw.

Additionally, each unattended magic item in the area must make a special saving throw with a bonus equal to its rarity (+0 for common, +2 for uncommon, +4 for rare, +6 for very rare, and +8 for legendary). The DC for this saving throw equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, the item's magic is suppressed for 1d6 days. Artifacts automatically succeed on this saving throw.

Each ongoing magical effect that isn't tied to a creature or magic item (such as wall of force) is automatically dispelled if it was created by a spell of 8th level or lower. For spells of 9th level, roll 1d20 + 6; on a result of 20 or higher, the spell is dispelled.

For each spell, magical effect, or magic item suppressed or dispelled by this spell, you regain 10 hit points.
