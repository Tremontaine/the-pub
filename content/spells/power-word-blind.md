# Power Word Blind

*6th-level enchantment*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V

You speak a word of power that causes one creature you can see within range to become blinded. If the target has 100 hit points or fewer, it is blinded for the duration. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.

The blinded target can make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, the spell ends.
