# Wail of the Banshee

*6th-level necromancy*
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (30-foot radius)
- **Components:** V
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

You channel the despair of the undead, your face momentarily transforming into a ghastly visage as you release a soul-piercing shriek that transcends the barriers between life and death. The wail manifests as a wave of spectral energy that ripples outward from you.

Each creature within 30 feet of you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8 psychic damage, is stunned until the end of its next turn, and must make a Death saving throw. On a successful Constitution save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't stunned or forced to make a Death saving throw.

A creature that fails its Death saving throw doesn't die but is haunted by the spectral wail. For the next 24 hours, it has disadvantage on all saving throws and ability checks, and appears partially translucent, as though partially shifted into the Ethereal Plane. This haunting effect can be ended by a remove curse or greater restoration spell.

Undead and constructs are particularly vulnerable to this spell, having disadvantage on their Constitution saving throw and taking an additional 2d8 necrotic damage if they fail their save.

**At Higher Levels.** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the psychic damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th.
